[Saheliya](http://www.saheliya.co.uk/) was set up in 1992 to provide a mental wellbeing service for black and ethnic minority women experiencing mental health issues caused by trauma, and living within oppressive cultural practices including forced marriage, honour based violence, physical, mental and financial abuse and female genital mutilation. Over the past year the chariy's 33 multilingual staff, who speak 28 community languages, have worked with more than 900 women, including asylum seekers and refugees, from 39 different countries. Saheliya's wellbeing service and learning centre provides a pathway to improve mental health, develop language and employability skills and support integration into the wider community.
