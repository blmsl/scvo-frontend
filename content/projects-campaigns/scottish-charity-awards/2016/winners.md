[Saheliya](http://www.saheliya.co.uk/) was set up in 1992 to provide a mental wellbeing service for black and ethnic minority women experiencing mental health issues caused by trauma, and living within oppressive cultural practices including forced marriage, honour based violence, physical, mental and financial abuse and female genital mutilation. Over the past year the chariy's 33 multilingual staff, who speak 28 community languages, have worked with more than 900 women, including asylum seekers and refugees, from 39 different countries. Saheliya's wellbeing service and learning centre provides a pathway to improve mental health, develop language and employability skills and support integration into the wider community.

### Charity champion

#### Gordon Aikman and Lucy Lintott

Gordon has raised more than £500,000 for Motor Neurone Disease research to help find a cure. He has worked to get the law changed so that anyone in Scotland who loses their voice has a right to technology to help them communicate. Gordon successfully lobbied the Scottish Government to give social care workers a pay rise, and raised awareness by telling his story in a moving BBC documentary. He has also kept MND in the public eye with his emotive columns, and he persuaded Nicola Sturgeon to publicly fund and double the number of MND specialist nurses.

Lucy started ‘Lucy’s fight’ to share her battle against Motor Neurone Disease in an honest and frank way. She believed that, while being diagnosed with MND is the worst thing, there was still so much she could do, maybe even more than she could before the diagnosis. Sharing her story has allowed her to do some incredible things. She has raised over £100,000 for MND Scotland, walked The Speyside Way, scuba dived, flown a plane, spoken to an audience of 1,000 - and she's still only 21!

### Cracking campaign

#### Disabled Access Day, Euan's Guide

Disabled Access Day aims to encourage disabled people to visit somewhere new, whether it’s a coffee shop, museum, sports centre or somewhere else. It’s also an opportunity for venues, businesses and organisations to showcase their accessibility, try something new themselves and engage with new customers. The annual event took place on 12 March 2016 across the UK and beyond. Over 10,000 disabled people, their friends and family got involved, taking the opportunity to visit one of the 1,067 venues that took part. The day has grown over four- fold since the pilot in 2015.

### Exceptional employee

#### Chris Martin, Callander Youth Project

I have shown a clear commitment and vision to ensure young people are at the core of every project, event and service delivered. I have led Callander Youth Project Trust from a small room in McLaren Learning Centre to a large, sustainable organisation offering vital youth work services from our hub in rural Stirlingshire. I have launched a number of social enterprises including the 5-star Callander Hostel and Bridgend Café, and made a commitment to endorse our work through a number of kite marks including Investors in Young People, Green Business Tourism and Living Wage accreditation, all showing my commitment to a fairer Scotland.

### Celebrating communities

#### Friends of Oban Community Playpark

The Friends of Oban set out to create an exciting and inclusive outdoor active playpark for the town on the west coast of Scotland for children aged 2 - 15 years. With overwhelming support from the local community, the first phase was completed in February 2016. One of its most proud achievements was raising over 40% of the funds from the local community. Young and old alike have joined in with diverse and sometimes wacky fund raising campaigns, including fish-bombing the town by creating over 800 fabric fish to decorate the sea front. The playpark was even showcased by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a great example of how community projects can produce inspirational results.
