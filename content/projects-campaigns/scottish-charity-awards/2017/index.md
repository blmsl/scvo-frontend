## The entries are in

In March we asked you to tell us which Scottish charities and individuals had been the best, most innovative and effective during the past year. We’ve been blown away with your response!

You’ve made hundreds of nominations, highlighting the huge range of incredible work going on all over the country.

With so many organisations, people and projects in the running, the competition is understandably high. Thankfully our judging panels are more than up for task of shortlisting.


## What’s next

There are eight award categories. The shortlist for each will be announced on 12 May.

All shortlisted charities and individuals are entered into the People’s Choice Award, sponsored by Charities Aid Foundation. Voting for that opens on 12 May and closes on 26 May.

The winners will be announced at the Scottish Charity Awards ceremony on 22 June.
