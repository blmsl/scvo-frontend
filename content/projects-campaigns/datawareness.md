We’re running a project to help charities and voluntary organisations understand the risks and opportunities assocated with using data in the digital age.

‘So, what’s data?’, I hear you say. Good question!

## Are you data aware?

Here’s a useful definition. Data is:

Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making; or information in an electronic format that can be stored and used by a computer.

As well as a strong focus on data protection and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) due to come into force in the UK in 2018, our Datawareness initiative will take a look at issues including data and fundraising, digital transformation, open data, data and decision-making, and more.

Each month, we’ll publish content with links to relevant events, information, resources and call on you to submit your burning data questions to be answered by our data experts.

Some of the themes we plan to cover include:

* Introduction to data protection
* Preparing for the new EU data protection regulation
* Data and fundraising
* Digital transformation
* Open data
* Data and decision-making

As well as all that, keep an eye out here for upcoming data related events.
