Human Rights are the basic freedoms that all people are entitled to. They cover the entire range of economic, social and cultural circumstances to give each and every one of us a universal set of principles to live and work by.

### Why this important to the third sector in Scotland

Human rights-based approaches can help us to make the most of the combined skills and experience of our sector. We want to see charities and voluntary organisations spreading their knowledge, promoting good work and sharing advice on best practice. That’s why we’ve developed the Right Approach campaign.
