# Welfare reform

UK Government welfare reforms are already devastating families and communities across Scotland. The impact of these cuts is affecting the work of many third sector organisations and its forecast that the worst is still to come.

## The story so far

* 63% of charities and third sector organisations in Scotland will be affected
* Three quarters of charities expect demand for services to increase significantly over the next year
* 81% of third sector organisations expect the financial situation for the sector to worsen in the next 10 months

## Taking it on

From mitigating the effects to creating visions about how to do things differently, the third sector will play a critical role in tackling welfare reform.

SCVO is working with the sector to share experiences and ideas as well as identify practical areas of collaboration.
