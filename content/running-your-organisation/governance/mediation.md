# Mediation

SCVO’s new mediation service can help nip any thorny issues in the bud.

Do any of these sound familiar?

* Disagreements between board members
* Volunteers and employees not seeing eye to eye
* Personality clashes

Could this be your organisation? Don’t let things get out of hand – seek help through mediation.

An independent mediator can help people work out and express what their issues are, and then explore what options might be available for moving forward.

In partnership with [Scottish Mediation](http://www.scottishmediation.org.uk/) we run a third sector helpline which offers information, advice and access to a low cost mediation service. Organisations with an annual income of under £50,000 may be eligible for mediation at no cost.
