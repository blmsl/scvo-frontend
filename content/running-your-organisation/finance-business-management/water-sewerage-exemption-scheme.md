# Water and sewerage exemption scheme

The [Scottish Government has an exemption scheme] (http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Business-Industry/waterindustryscot/watercharges/exemptionscheme) to help charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) with the cost of their water and waste water bills.  

The scheme is administered by the water industry on behalf of the Scottish Government.

Since April 2015, support has been available to charities registered with the [Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR)] (http://www.oscr.org.uk/) and CASCs with an income below £300,000.  

There are some exceptions. 

Charities and CASCs will not be eligible for support where one or more of the following conditions are met:

* the charity holds a permanent alcohol licence to sell alcohol at the premises
* the premises is a charity shop or other premises used for the purposes of retailing new or second hand merchandise
* the premises operates as a café which is open to the public and operated on a regular basis to generate income. This excludes canteens that have been provided by the charity to support its own volunteers
* the organisation is a Local Authority or an Arms-Length External Organisation (ALEO) which organisations that can be used by councils to deliver services

Application forms are available from your Licensed Provider.  If you do not have a licensed provider, you will need to select one. You can find more information about providers at [Scotland on Tap] (http://www.scotlandontap.gov.uk/)
