# Community capacity & resilience fund

## £1.9m further funding announced for grassroots action

On 22 February 2017, Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, announced £1.9 million of new funding to help local third sector groups and organisations across Scotland tackle poverty and mitigate against UK government welfare changes.

The investment will be delivered from 2017 to 2020. It builds upon work developed by SCVO, Development Trusts Associations Scotland and the Scottish Community Alliance to ensure those who are working at the local level can deliver direct support to communities.

For SCVO the new funding will be distributed through phase three of the Community Capacity and Resilience Fund, with the application process expected to open in the autumn of 2017.
