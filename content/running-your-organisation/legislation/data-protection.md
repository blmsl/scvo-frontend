# Data Protection Act

If you hold and process information about your clients, employees or suppliers, you are legally obliged to protect that information. Under the Data Protection Act you must:

* Only collect information that you need for a specific purpose
* Keep it secure
* Ensure it is relevant and up to date
* Only hold as much as you need, and only for as long as you need it
* Allow the subject of the information to see it on request

If you handle personal information you may need to register with the [Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)](https://ico.org.uk/) as a data controller. Notification is a statutory requirement and every organisation that processes personal information must notify the ICO unless they are exempt. Failure to notify is a criminal offence.

The ICO has an online [Data Protection Self-Assessment Toolkit](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/data-protection-self-assessment-toolkit/) which provides a ‘health check’ of where organisations are currently in relation to the specific areas covered in the toolkit: records management, security and the handling of subject access requests.

For the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is likely to come in 2018, the ICO has produced a [Preparing for the GDPR – 12 Steps guide](https://ico.org.uk/media/1624219/preparing-for-the-gdpr-12-steps.pdf) for organisations to assess current practice in specific areas, and what they should be considering over the next two years.

Organisations can also sign up to the [E-newsletter | ICO](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/e-newsletter/) to stay up to date with new guidance as and when it is released.
