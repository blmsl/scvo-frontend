# Fire Safety

Under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, fire safety is based on the principles of risk assessment and places responsibility for assessing risk from fire and providing appropriate fire safety measures with those with control to any extent of premises (duty holders).

More than one person can have fire safety responsibilities for premises. For example, an employer, owner, tenant and voluntary group using the premises may each have responsibilities, and will be required to cooperate with each other and coordinate their fire safety measures. If you run a community building or hall then the management committee must have a commitment to fire safety.
