# Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) scheme

The PVG Scheme is a registration system for anyone who carries out work (paid or unpaid) with vulnerable groups in Scotland. It is designed to exclude people who are known to be unsuitable from working with vulnerable groups and detects those who become unsuitable while in the workplace.

##Who is included in a vulnerable group?

People who are protected by the PVG Scheme are:

* individuals under the age of 18 (children)
* individuals over the age of 16 who are provided with care, health, community care or welfare services (protected adults)

## What do I need to do?

If your organisation has paid staff or volunteers who are carrying out regulated work, you need access to scheme records. You must either:

* register with [Disclosure Scotland](http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/), which will enable them to countersign disclosure applications or requests
* or enrol with a registered body that can provide countersignatory services for them [Volunteer Scotland Disclosure Services](http://www.volunteerscotland.net/disclosure-services/) can help with this.

## Will it cost anything?

Disclosure checks on volunteers are free and are carried out by [Volunteer Scotland Disclosure Services](Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) scheme).

Disclosure checks carried out on paid employees will cost money, and are generally carried out by Disclosure Scotland. Information about fees is available from [Disclosure Scotland](http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/disclosureinformation). 


## Do I need to know anything else?

Disclosure Scotland has a [guidance booklet](http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/disclosureinformation/guidance.htm) which outlines everything you need to know about the PVG Scheme.
