## Helping you make the most of professional connections and peer support

SCVOâ€™s professional networks offer great opportunities for you to meet people with similar roles from across the sector.

Through seminars, informal events, conferences and bulletins we help you to connect with your peers, share knowledge and catch up with the latest developments in your field of interest.
