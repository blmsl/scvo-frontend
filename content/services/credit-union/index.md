# Credit Union

As Scotland's leading voluntary sector credit union we offer low-cost loans, easy savings facilities, payroll deduction and quick bank transfers.

So what makes us different from high street banks and building societies?

It’s simple – our ethos. We are a co-operative, accountable only to our members. In other words, our members come first.
