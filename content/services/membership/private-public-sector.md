# SCVO membership | associate

## SCVO membership for consultants, public sector bodies and commercial businesses.

Scotland’s third sector is thriving. With an annual income of £4.5 billion, assets of £8.6 billion and 138,000 staff, the sector is increasing in size, reach and influence. The great news is that this means our sector now supports more communities across Scotland than ever before.

The public and private sectors are keen to get involved with the Scottish third sector. SCVO associate membership is a great way to stay connected to the big issues our sector is talking about.
