# About SCVO

The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) is the membership organisation for Scotland’s charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.

SCVO works in partnership with the voluntary sector to advance our shared values and interests. We have over 1800 members who range from individuals and grassroots groups, to Scotland-wide organisations and intermediary bodies. Through lobbying and campaigning SCVO works to advance the interests of our members and the people and communities that they support.

Our services help charities and third sector organisations across Scotland focus on what they do best, whether that’s supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities or conducting cutting edge research. From providing a payroll service to third sector organisations to creating thousands of jobs for young people in charities across Scotland, SCVO’s services make a real difference.
Strategic Plan

SCVO’s strategic plan over the coming year covers five main objectives:

* Increasing access within the third sector to good quality information and services.
* Increasing access to volunteer and job opportunities in the third sector.
* Increasing opportunities for interests from all areas of civil society to network, connect interests and access services.
* Increasing access to programmes that improve practice and build collective third sector capacity.
* Ensuring that the public and civil society has increased opportunities to learn about and from third sector expertise and experience.
