# Information for employers

## What is an internship?

There is no legal definition of an intern. However a good guideline is that interns should develop their professional skills and understanding of a profession by undertaking work of value.

Internships are short-term positions that offer mutual benefits to the host organisation and the intern. An internship provides a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who wish to develop hands-on experience in a certain occupational field.

Internships should be clearly distinct from other opportunities that may be available in your organisation, such as job roles, work experience, apprenticeships or volunteering.

All Disability Equality Internships are temporary positions delivering a specific, discrete piece of work providing the organisation with a short term resource to deliver this meaningful work which is of value to the organisation and at the same time providing the intern with a satisfying work experience.

* All internships will last a total of 455 hours, allowing flexibility with the weekly work hours based on reasonable adjustment needs. All internships will be completed by 30 June 2017.
* All interns should be paid a minimum of £8.45 an hour. Employers are encouraged to pay more when possible.
* Interns should be provided with a job title and clearly defined role. This role should give the intern the opportunity to produce work independently and hold responsibilities within the organisation.
* All interns have an employee/employer relationship with their host organisation. They must legally become an employee of the organisation and be issued with a contract of employment and terms and conditions of employment as well as being subject to all existing organisational policies (e.g. health and safety, equalities etc).
* Internships should be designed to allow the participant to develop existing skills and acquire new ones in order to enhance their career prospects.
* All interns should be supervised.
* On completing their internship, all interns should have demonstrable evidence of the work they have done that will enhance their CV or portfolio.

## What employers get from the Disability Equality Internship Programme

There are many benefits:

* a fund of £3991.90 available per vacancy to cover the employees wage & employer national insurance contributions
* can provide mentoring or supervisory experience for existing members of staff
* the opportunity to have a specific piece of work undertaken that would not otherwise be done
* access to a highly motivated pool of people, bringing new ideas and new thinking to their organisation
* access to support and resources from the Disability Equality Internship programme team at all times, before and during the internship, this includes guidance and support on accessibility and reasonable adjustment requirements.

We’re looking for employers who care about their staff and have the capacity to mentor someone who may be new to the world of work.

All our employers must be third sector organisations – this includes charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises. 

Employers must commit to providing a high quality package of support, including:

* an induction

## What we’re looking for in an Disability Equality Internship opportunity

* that provide a range of additional support to the intern to improve the quality of the opportunity, including induction, regular support and supervision and provision of a reference.
* where each intern will be provided with a job title and clearly defined role. This role should give the intern the opportunity to produce work independently and hold responsibilities within the organisation.
* that allow the intern to develop existing skills and acquire new ones in order to enhance their career prospects.
* across Scotland and aim to be across a range of occupational sectors including social care, conservation, community recycling, sports, creative industries, youth work, housing, etc.
