# Business Growth Graduate Internship Programme

SCVOâ€™s Business Growth Graduate Internship Programme created internship opportunities for young people within Scottish third sector organisations, micro businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

We worked with our partners Creative Scotland, Scottish Government, Scottish Disability Equality Forum and Inclusion Scotland to create paid internship opportunities throughout Scotland.

The internships covered a variety of areas, with a special focus on digital opportunities in the creative industries.

At present we are supporting [Disability Equality Internships](disability-equality-internships/index.md). These opportunities are open to graduates with a disability or long-term health condition.
