# Third Sector Internships

SCVO worked in partnership with [Queen Margaret University](http://www.qmu.ac.uk/) and [The Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/choose/ou/ony_r11?OFFAD=sc003g&MEDIA=inc_scotland) in Scotland to create paid internships within third sector organisations for undergraduate and postgraduate students at Scottish universities.

Funded by the [Scottish Funding Council](http://www.sfc.ac.uk/), the Third Sector Internships Scotland (TSIS) project enabled third sector organisations to access the talent of students to deliver a specific piece of work/project. By offering paid, supported internships, students made meaningful contributions to charities, social enterprises and voluntary organisations.

The experiences enhanced studentsâ€™ employability and created local level change and nationwide impact.

We are keen to share our learning as broadly as possible with key stakeholders, and offer the resources below to help others achieve similar results.
