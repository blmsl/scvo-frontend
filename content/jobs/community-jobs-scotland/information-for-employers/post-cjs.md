# Community Jobs Scotland

## After CJS

Community Jobs Scotland (CJS) jobs are fixed contract posts. These are the steps you should take when your employee is due to finish their contract.

### What to do when your employee leaves

The week that the CJS employee is due to leave you we need to you to complete several actions:

* conduct an Exit Interview
* complete the online CJS Leaver Form

Submitting the completed CJS Leaver Form to SCVO allows the final funding payment to be released to your organisation. 

If your employee leaves before the end of their contract you must notify us immediately.

You can find more detailed information in our **[CJS Employer Guidance] http://www.scvo.org.uk/long-form-posts/cjs-employer-guidance/**.

### Supporting your employee after they’ve left

Here are some useful initiatives that could help your employee into work or training after they leave your organisation:

* [Employer recruitment incentive](https://www.ourskillsforce.co.uk/funding-for-skills/employer-recruitment-incentive/)
* [Modern apprenticeships](http://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/our-services/modern-apprenticeships/)
* [Our Skills Force](http://www.ourskillsforce.co.uk/)

## Tracking the progress of CJS employees

To continue demonstrating the benefits of the Community Jobs Scotland programme, it is important that we track positive outcomes for CJS employees after they leave their CJS job.

If you’re aware of a CJS employee success story please get in touch with us to share the good news. Contact cjsstartpapers@scvo.org.uk or call Brian McNeary  0141 559 5018 with the details.

## Compliance and audit

SCVO has entered into a contract with the Scottish Government to deliver Community Jobs Scotland across the whole of Scotland.  SCVO, as the Managing Agent for the third sector organisations who provide the job vacancies, has a responsibility to ensure that the employing organisations provide their jobs in accordance with the conditions of the Community Jobs Scotland programme.

All employers are required to retain documentation relating to their CJS employee(s) period of employment including copies of the all CJS paperwork.  This documentation has to be made available upon request for compliance and audit purposes.

SCVO staff will get in touch with the employing organisation to arrange any compliance visits.  During a compliance visit SCVO staff will speak to relevant staff, a CJS employee and view  paperwork relating to the employee.
