## Recruiting & starting your employee

Now that you’ve been given the go-ahead to recruit your CJS employee, here is some useful information on how to advertise your CJS post, interview the candidates and what to do on their first day.

### Advertising your post

CJS vacancies are advertised on our [dedicated jobs page](http://jobs.scvo.org.uk/).

If you want to advertise your job more widely you can market it through your own media channels, but please remember to include an eligibility statement to ensure only eligible young people apply for the CJS vacancy.

All CJS applicants will be referred by an adviser from either Jobcentre Plus or Skills Development Scotland. You can only interview candidates if you have an Eligibility Referral Form signed by an adviser.

### Interviewing your candidates

Please let your SCVO contact know when you have set an interview date for your job.

As with any other job, you will shortlist and interview your preferred candidates and select the person you want to offer the job to.

Before you can offer the job to your preferred candidate, you must get in touch with your named SCVO contact to confirm details of who you would like to offer the job to and the intended start date.

Please note, once you appoint a young person under Community Jobs Scotland the relationship will be as employer and employee, subject to your own organisational employment and staff policies and procedures.

For more detailed information on CJS recruitment, please see our **[CJS Employer Guidance] http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CJS-Employer-Guidance-v4-3.docx**.

### Starting your employee

#### Their first day

On the day that your employee starts we need to you to complete several actions:

* Complete your Online CJS Start form
* Return the original signed Eligibility Referral form to SCVO by post

You should also provide your CJS employee with:
* ‘What You Need To Know About Your New Job’ leaflet
* Money Advice Service leaflet
* Young Scot Extra services flyer

Once we receive all of your completed paperwork, SCVO will authorise and forward the advance payment.

Payments will continue until the end of the CJS contracted period of employment or when SCVO are notified of an early leave date.

You can find more detailed information in our **[CJS Employer Guidance] http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CJS-Employer-Guidance-v4-3.docx**

#### The first two weeks

A good inductions process is essential to helping your CJS employee settle into their job and be more confident and productive.

When your CJS employee starts their job you should:

* provide staff induction
* issue a contract of employment
* provide a copy of their full job description
* provide a named supervisor
* set monthly progress reviews
