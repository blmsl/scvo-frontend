# Contact information & keeping records

When you start your new job you’ll be given some important documents and paperwork. Here’s a checklist of things you should keep in a safe place. You never know when you might need them in an emergency! 

You should keep a note of the following and save the relevant contact details into your mobile phone:

* Your supervisor’s name and contact details
* The address and telephone number of your workplace (if different from above)
* The name and contact details of who to contact for payroll enquiries
* Any relevant health and safety information for your job, like the location of the accident book
* The date you commenced your employment and when you are due to finish

You should keep the following in a safe place:

* Your letter of appointment and/or your contract of employment
* Your job description and a copy of your terms and conditions of employment, staff handbook or equivalent
* Written notes of support meetings with your supervisor
* The payslips you receive while in your job
* Any documents from HMRC and Jobcentre Plus and/or Skills Development Scotland relating to your job.
