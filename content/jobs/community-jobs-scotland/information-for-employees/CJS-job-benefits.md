# Your CJS job & your benefits

Your new job will affect your access to benefits like Jobseekers Allowance, Employment Support Allowance and Working Tax Credits.

It is important to remember that this is a job. This means that you are not entitled to claim out of work benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) or Employment Support Allowance (ESA) while you are working.

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may still be able to claim in-work benefits such as Working Tax Credit. It is your responsibility to ensure you have informed the necessary authorities of your change in circumstances and do not claim benefits you are not entitled to. Your Jobcentre Plus or Skills Development Scotland adviser should be able to help you with this. You can also check your entitlement by using the online Benefits Adviser tool at www.gov.uk/benefits-adviser

Please be aware that if you leave your CJS job before the end of your contract period your eligibility to claim benefit may be affected.
