## What to do if you have a problem with your employer

If your employer is not meeting these expectations, you should first try to raise it as an issue with your supervisor or by following your employer’s own grievance procedures.

If your concerns cannot be resolved and you continue to have issues, please contact the Community Jobs Scotland team by phoning the CJS Helpline on 0141 559 5006 or email [communityjobsscotland@scvo.org.uk](mailto:communityjobsscotland@scvo.org.uk).
