# Careers advice and job searching

Resources to help you find a job when you move on from Community Jobs Scotland.

## My World of Work

We encourage everyone on Community Jobs Scotland to use the careers tools and advice available on the Skills Development Scotland website ‘My World of Work’. This site is free to use and helps you to:

* plan your career
* identify your strengths
* build a CV
* apply for work
* prepare for interviews

## Other resources

Your employer should support you to keep up jobsearching activities while in your job.
