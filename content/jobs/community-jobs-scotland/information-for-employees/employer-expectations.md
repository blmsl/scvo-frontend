# What your employer expects from you

You have signed a contract of employment with your employer so they have the same expectations of you as every other employee.

This means that (as a minimum) you should:

* Be on time and in work when expected
* Let your supervisor know straight away if you cannot come to work or are running late for any reason, including illness
* Follow appropriate steps to arrange absence from work (e.g. to take holiday or to attend training), ensuring you allow plenty of time for your leave to be considered and planned for
* Comply with all health and safety regulations – it is your responsibility to ensure your own safety and not risk the safety of others
* Do your job to the best of your ability
* Take care of your appearance, making sure you wear appropriate clothing
* Treat your colleagues and the organisation’s customers with courtesy and respect
* Be open to new experiences and willing to learn new skills according to the needs of your job

Your employer is entitled to take disciplinary procedures leading to your dismissal if necessary.
