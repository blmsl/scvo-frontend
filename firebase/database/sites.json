        "en" : "# About SCVO\n\nThe Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) is the membership organisation for Scotland’s charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.\n\nSCVO works in partnership with the voluntary sector to advance our shared values and interests. We have over 1800 members who range from individuals and grassroots groups, to Scotland-wide organisations and intermediary bodies. Through lobbying and campaigning SCVO works to advance the interests of our members and the people and communities that they support.\n\nOur services help charities and third sector organisations across Scotland focus on what they do best, whether that’s supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities or conducting cutting edge research. From providing a payroll service to third sector organisations to creating thousands of jobs for young people in charities across Scotland, SCVO’s services make a real difference.\nStrategic Plan\n\nSCVO’s strategic plan over the coming year covers five main objectives:\n\n* Increasing access within the third sector to good quality information and services.\n* Increasing access to volunteer and job opportunities in the third sector.\n* Increasing opportunities for interests from all areas of civil society to network, connect interests and access services.\n* Increasing access to programmes that improve practice and build collective third sector capacity.\n* Ensuring that the public and civil society has increased opportunities to learn about and from third sector expertise and experience.\n\n## Annual Report 2014 -15\n\nOur Annual Report is presented by our Directors, together with the audited financial statement for the year ended 31 March 2015. It is available for download in the following formats.\n\n[SCVO Annual Report 2014 – 15 (PDF format)]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCVO-Financial-Statements-2014-15.pdf**\n\n[SCVO Annual Report 2014 – 15 (Word format)]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCVO-Financial-Statements-2014-15.docx**\n\n## Board\n\nSCVO is governed by a board of directors. They are responsible for the strategic management of SCVO. They control and supervise our activities, set a vision for the organisation, and run SCVO in a way that will achieve these aims.\n\nMost of our board members are elected from our membership. Some have been co-opted to bring special skill sets to the group.\n\n### Current board members\n\nShulah Allan, Convener\n\nNeville Mackay, Vice Convener\n\nPaul Bannon, Treasurer - [Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland](http://www.chss.org.uk/)\n\nJay Butler\n\nGraham Curran\n\nRebecca Duff, [MS Society Scotland](https://www.mssociety.org.uk/near-me/branches/ms-society-scotland)\n\nGordon MacRae, [The Humanist Society Scotland](http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk/)\n\nMichelle Carruthers, [Food Train](http://www.thefoodtrain.co.uk/)\n\nTheresa Shearer, [Enable Scotland](http://www.enable.org.uk/)\n\nEliot Stark, [STRiVE](http://strive.me.uk/)\n\n## Policy Committee\n\nThe Policy Committee advises us on policies which reflect the best interests of the third sector in Scotland.

        "en" : "# Information for employers\n\n## What is an internship?\n\nThere is no legal definition of an intern. However a good guideline is that interns should develop their professional skills and understanding of a profession by undertaking work of value.\n\nInternships are short-term positions that offer mutual benefits to the host organisation and the intern. An internship provides a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who wish to develop hands-on experience in a certain occupational field.\n\nInternships should be clearly distinct from other opportunities that may be available in your organisation, such as job roles, work experience, apprenticeships or volunteering.\n\nAll Disability Equality Internships are temporary positions delivering a specific, discrete piece of work providing the organisation with a short term resource to deliver this meaningful work which is of value to the organisation and at the same time providing the intern with a satisfying work experience.\n\n* All internships will last a total of 455 hours, allowing flexibility with the weekly work hours based on reasonable adjustment needs. All internships will be completed by 30 June 2017.\n* All interns should be paid a minimum of £8.45 an hour. Employers are encouraged to pay more when possible.\n* Interns should be provided with a job title and clearly defined role. This role should give the intern the opportunity to produce work independently and hold responsibilities within the organisation.\n* All interns have an employee/employer relationship with their host organisation. They must legally become an employee of the organisation and be issued with a contract of employment and terms and conditions of employment as well as being subject to all existing organisational policies (e.g. health and safety, equalities etc).\n* Internships should be designed to allow the participant to develop existing skills and acquire new ones in order to enhance their career prospects.\n* All interns should be supervised.\n* On completing their internship, all interns should have demonstrable evidence of the work they have done that will enhance their CV or portfolio.\n\n## What employers get from the Disability Equality Internship Programme\n\nThere are many benefits:\n\n* a fund of £3991.90 available per vacancy to cover the employees wage & employer national insurance contributions\n* can provide mentoring or supervisory experience for existing members of staff\n* the opportunity to have a specific piece of work undertaken that would not otherwise be done\n* access to a highly motivated pool of people, bringing new ideas and new thinking to their organisation\n* access to support and resources from the Disability Equality Internship programme team at all times, before and during the internship, this includes guidance and support on accessibility and reasonable adjustment requirements.\n\n## What we’re looking for in an employer\n\nWe’re looking for employers who care about their staff and have the capacity to mentor someone who may be new to the world of work.\n\nAll our employers must be third sector organisations – this includes charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises. \n\nEmployers must commit to providing a high quality package of support, including:\n\n* an induction\n* on-the job training\n* support and supervision\n\n## What we’re looking for in an Disability Equality Internship opportunity\n\n* based around a discrete piece of work with a specific focus that is of value to the organisation, rather than a more general role within the organisation.\n* based around 455 hours, with weekly hours based around reasonable adjustment needs and paid at £8.45 per hour.\n* the intern will be employed directly by the organisation and subject to their policies and procedures.\n* that provide a range of additional support to the intern to improve the quality of the opportunity, including induction, regular support and supervision and provision of a reference.\n* where each intern will be provided with a job title and clearly defined role. This role should give the intern the opportunity to produce work independently and hold responsibilities within the organisation.\n* that allow the intern to develop existing skills and acquire new ones in order to enhance their career prospects.\n* across Scotland and aim to be across a range of occupational sectors including social care, conservation, community recycling, sports, creative industries, youth work, housing, etc.\n\n## Who can apply for an DEIP internship?\n\nPeople who:\n\n* define as disabled under the Equality Act 2010 which defines disability as: someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities\n* are unemployed or under employed\n\n## Apply to host an Disability Equality intern\n\nIf you would like to create an internship opportunity please start by completing the [online Employer Registration](http://scvo.force.com/empregintern).\n\nIf your organisation is already working with SCVO through the current Community Jobs Scotland programme then you do not need to submit a copy of Employers Liability Insurance certificate and sample contract of employment.\n\nPlease look at the additional information/guidance documents below prior to completing your application:\n\n**[Disability Equality Internship Information] http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Disability-Equality-Internship-Information-v1.2.doc**    \n**Developing an Internship project – hints and tips http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Developing-an-Internship-project-hints-and-tips.docx**\n\nSCVO will check your application to ensure organisational eligibility and then issue a log in to the Employment Service Customer Portal, allowing you to create an internship opportunity. \n\nAs part of the application process, [Inclusion Scotland] (http://www.inclusionscotland.org/) will contact each employer to discuss and conduct a workplace access assessment to help identify and consider any potential barriers to the employment of a disabled person and provide relevant advice.\n\nCall 0141 559 5026 for assistance and any questions.\n\n## Support available for employers and interns\n\nSCVO is working in partnership with [Inclusion Scotland] (http://www.inclusionscotland.org/) to provide specialist support for both employers and interns, before and during the internship period, including:\n\n### Employer support\n\n* Workplace accessibility assessment includes providing guidance on reasonable adjustments\n* Shortlisting/recruitment support\n* Identify and assist with access requirements\n* Access to Work/reasonable adjustment requirements support\n\n### Applicant/Intern\n\n* Application support/guidance\n* Interview support\n* Access to Work application support\n* Peer mentoring/networking opportunities\n* In-work support\n\n[Inclusion Scotland] (http://www.inclusionscotland.org/) is a consortium of disability organisations, individual disabled people and social partners who share their aims. They work towards eradicating the barriers – physical, economic, cultural and attitudinal – which prevent disabled people being fully included in society.\n\n## Guide to good employment practice\n\nThis resource provides help, information and guidance on employing a young person through SCVO employability programmes.\n\nPlease note this pack provides information which is readily available from a variety of sources.

It is national programme that is delivered locally.\n\nCharities, community groups, social enterprises and voluntary organisations of all shapes and sizes already make significant impacts in areas like early intervention, prevention and care, and support for people with complex and multiple conditions. With the right support, there is scope for them to make even more of a difference.\n\n## The story so far\n\nBHHC sought to improve understanding of how a strategic investment in the capacity of the third sector can manage demand for statutory services and improve the quality of life for people in their own communities.\n\nA pathfinder (pilot) for the national programme took place in East Dunbartonshire between October 2013 and March 2015. Its aim was to understand how a change in community capacity can enable prevention at the locality and primary care levels.\n\nThe learning and experience of the pathfinder is documented in a series of reports, all of which present compelling evidence to demonstrate that the objective was achieved, and as such will now inform future developments.\n\n**infographic http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BHHC-Infographic-web-940x549px.png**\n\n## What’s happening now?\n\nOur Outcomes Evaluation Report from the pathfinder work is now available. You can access it by following the link below.\n\n**Download the Outcomes Evaluation Report http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BHHC-Outcomes-screen.pdf**\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe BHHC pathfinder has:\n\n“…built a movement of people from all sectors who are committed to working together to develop health and happiness in a different way.”\n\nThe learning from the BHHC approach in East Dunbartonshire now provides a timely offer to integration authorities as they consider how community-based approaches and the third sector offer can support the delivery of the national health and wellbeing outcomes.\n\nThe learning from BHHC has been included in our Learning about Capacity Building report (see below) which captures learning from a range of partnership programmes, supported by the Joint Improvement Team (JIT), to build third sector capacity to contribute towards Reshaping Care for Older People and the integration of adult health and social care. Each of these programmes achieved a range of excellent outcomes and generated learning about what works and what doesn’t in relation to capacity building.\n\nWe hope these major lessons will help to improve our knowledge and understanding of what works and inform future design, commissioning, delivery and policy-making on capacity building.\n\n**Embed URL https://readymag.com/u24124000/564818/1**\n\n## Understanding asset mapping and partnerhsip\n\nSCVO’s ambition is for the third sector to play an increasing role in improving health and social care, and in supporting individuals to support themselves and others. It is important that this role is recognised by all partners and that the third sector is acknowledged as an equal partner in delivering quality health and social care in contributing to addressing health inequalities within communities.\n\nFollowing receipt of Scottish Government funding to bring community assets to the health and social care community planning table, SCVO commissioned the Employment Research Institute of Edinburgh Napier University to review asset based approaches, how these relate to health and social care integration and the opportunities for third sector partnering. In collaboration with the local third sector interfaces, and building on the pilot work in East Dunbartonshire, the report focuses on three pilot areas: Falkirk, Aberdeen City, and Argyll and Bute. The report is now available and SCVO is working with partners to assess its conclusions and consider how to take forward the recommendations at both local and national level.\n\n**Download ‘Understanding Asset-Mapping and Partnering in Scotland: a report into the activities and resources of Scottish voluntary organisations’. http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asset-Mapping-Final-Report-April-2016.docx**\n\n## Get involved\n\nIf you’d like to get involved, please contact a member of the team using the contact details at the bottom of the page.\n\n### East Dunbartonshire project updates\n\nThe following nine projects were funded to take forward their new ideas for improving the health and wellbeing of East Dunbartonshire communities, including an allotment for people with limited mobility and drama and digital workshops for those affected by life traumas.\n\nWe continues to support the projects to deliver and evaluate their work until March 2015. All of the projects are committed to sharing their experiences and learning – check out the project updates below!\n\n#### Aftercare through Arts and Technology\n\nAftercare through Arts and Technology, managed by [Group Recovery Aftercare Community Enterprise (GRACE)](http://www.graceaftercare.co.uk/about), is delivering a series of drama and digital arts workshops to boost the confidence and skills of people affected by life traumas, such as addictions, mental ill-health and homelessness.\n\nUpdate: [This great new video](http://vimeo.com/118573113) shows the difference GRACE is making, not just to the people who are involved but to their families who are also noticing that they are healthier and happier.\n\n#### Carers’ Wellbeing Reviews\n\nCarers’ Wellbeing Reviews, managed by [Carers Link](http://carerslink.org.uk/), is providing a tailored and more intensive approach to carers’ health and wellbeing, supporting their needs to access other services or change a behaviour.\n\nUpdate: Being able to talk to someone about their needs is making such a difference to the lives of carers supported by Carers Link.  From simple things, like getting a massage, to more intensive help to quit smoking, all of this support is helping individuals to feel good about themselves.\n\n#### East Dunbartonshire Asset Map Launch\n\nEast Dunbartonshire Asset Map Launch, managed by [East Dunbartonshire Association for Mental Health](http://www.edamh.org.uk/), is enabling the local community to find about healthy and enjoyable activities in their area, by helping them to understand and use the Asset Map.\n\nUpdate: Throughout East Dunbartonshire local people have been able to own the asset map, by identifying and mapping the places that make them feel good. There is a really wide range of suggestions on offer and there truly is something for everyone.\n\n#### East Dunbartonshire Green Gym\n\nEast Dunbartonshire Green Gym, managed by [The Conservation Volunteers in Scotland](http://www.tcv.org.uk/scotland/feel-good/green-gyms/community-green-gyms), is applying a tried and tested formula to improve their local environment, getting fit and having fun in the process.\n\nUpdate: Get down to Merkland Local Nature Reserve or Tintock woods to check out what these Green Gymers have been doing! From woodland thinning, litter picking, removing patches of rhododendron and paths cleared – you can’t fail to notice the difference!\n\n#### Hear to Help\n\nHear to Help, managed by [Action on Hearing Loss](http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/), is scaling up a successful project that already exists in East Dunbartonshire to support people to operate and look after their hearing aids, so they are able to participate more fully in all aspects of day-to-day life.\n\nUpdate: [Hear to Help](http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/scotland/services-in-scotland/hear-to-help.aspx) is powering ahead with drop-ins in sheltered housing and care homes offering help to get residents and care staff supported and trained in keeping hearing aids in tip-top condition and getting folks listening and involved in daily life.\n\n#### Partner-ED\n\nPartner-ED, managed by [Ceartas](http://www.ceartas.org.uk/), are working to improve services by developing the skills, knowledge and confidence of the local community to participate in designing and developing health and social care services, so that they meet the needs of the people who use them.\n\nUpdate: Sessions for volunteers have started  and will run for  seven weeks. So far the response has been great!\n\n#### Rosebank Allotments Service\n\nRosebank Allotments Service, managed by [CarrGomm](http://www.carrgomm.org/about-us) aims to improve access to the health and well-being benefits of working in an allotment for people with limited mobility, by installing raised beds.\n\nUpdate: With the improved weather, building the raised beds is completed and now people with mobility impairment can begin spring planting.\n\n#### Twechar Meal Delivery Service\n\nTwechar Meal Delivery Service, managed by [Twechar Community Action](http://www.twecharhlec.org.uk/index.php?page=ABOUT%20US&cols=1), will use a meal delivery service to give local older and vulnerable people a healthy meal and provide them with information and support to help them participate in community activities.\n\nUpdate: Older people having been enjoying meals for some weeks now – and mince and tatties is proving to be a very popular choice! The project is starting to identify other unmet needs such a book delivery in partnership with the local library.\n\n#### Youths on Bikes Scheme\n\nYouths on Bikes Scheme (YOBS), managed by [East Dunbartonshire Cycle Co-op](http://www.edscyclecoop.org.uk/), seeks to reduce the social isolation and loneliness of house bound and older people in the community of Auchinairn, through intergenerational opportunities.\n\nUpdate: With YOBS training underway the focus shifts to organising visits to older people on their bikes and deliver fresh food and groceries.\n",

It tends to happen continuously, but sets of information may be gathered together at regular intervals, for example quarterly.\n\n**Evaluation** is when you assess whether what you have been doing is really making the difference that you intended it to. It tends to happen less frequently, for example annually or at the end of a longer-term project.\n\n**Review** is when you look at the results of an evaluation and decide whether it needs to change. Information from monitoring may also prompt a review of a small area of your work, but a substantial review can only take place once a proper evaluation of your effectiveness has taken place. Review may take place annually or at the end of a longer term project.\n\n## What kind of information should you collect?\n\nThe voluntary management committee should decide what information they require in order to monitor, evaluate and review. If there are staff, they should also have an input. Other partners may also have ideas, and some funders may require certain information to be gathered as a condition of funding. If so, make sure you collect this information from the beginning. You must plan for monitoring, evaluation and review at the beginning of your work. Trying to collect information to prove your worth in retrospect is extremely difficult.\n\nIt is important to decide the level of detail of information required, and to identify ‘key indicators’ that reflect your aims and objectives as laid out in your business plan. A key indicator is something that you can measure to show whether you are, or not, achieving your aims and objectives. The changes in the measurements of these key indicators will give a picture of how you are performing over time.\n\nKey indicators will vary depending on the organisation. They will usually be a mixture of ‘hard indicators’ (quantitative, more objective eg number of clients worked with; income and expenditure figures) or ‘soft indicators’ (qualitative, more subjective eg clients’ perception of how the service has helped them; opinion of partner organisations).\nBy monitoring the information you collect, you should be able to demonstrate that you are on the right track. But it is only when you properly evaluate that you will discover whether you are really making a difference.\n## How do you evaluate that information?\n\nEvaluation is an assessment of whether your organisation has made a difference. It includes:\n\n* Outputs – things you have produced – for example you may have set up a credit union and published a money management guide\n* Outcomes – what happened as a result of the outputs – members of your credit union and users of your guide are better able to manage money\n* Impact Assessment – the overall impact of your activity – poverty levels amongst service users is reducing.\n\nOutputs and outcomes are mainly related to your objectives but it is the impact assessment that is most directly related to your aim.\n\nMonitoring, evaluation and review is not always a simple process and can be filled with jargon which can often confuse. It is well worth seeking advice and help from other sources. As a first step you should always ask yourself this question: ‘What information will prove that what I’m doing is making the difference I said it would?’ Remember, effective monitoring, evaluation and review will help your organisation survive.",

        "en" : "# Reserves\n\nVoluntary management committee members have a duty to use their organisation’s funds within a reasonable time of receiving them. However, organisations need to be able to secure their future, absorb setbacks, and take advantage of change and opportunity. Many provide for this by putting income aside, when they can afford to, as a reserve for future plans, or against future uncertainties.\n\nTo overcome the possible perception that an organisation is hoarding its money, and asking the public for funds that are not immediately needed, it is essential to be able to explain the position on reserves. Responsibility for this lies with the voluntary management committee, who should develop, and make clear in the annual report, a justifiable strategy for holding funds in reserve.\n\nIt is not acceptable to have a high level of reserves, high in actual terms or even just proportionate to turnover, if they cannot be justified. For charities specifically this could be seen as not properly directing the resources of the charity to the furtherance of its charitable objectives. Long-term commitments to staff or leases, or refurbishment plans which may have to be paid out of reserves, should however, be taken into account.\n\nReserves are often expressed in terms of future weeks’ expenditure. The voluntary management committee may wish to set a target of, say, three months operating costs, to hold in reserve.\n\nOne problem with reserves is that some grant makers will not provide funds to an organisation with, as they see it, ‘too much money’ in reserve. When applying for funds, you should establish funders’ policy on reserves.",

        "en" : "# Risk analysis & management\nRisk is an important matter for voluntary management committee members to consider. A business plan should include an assessment of the risks associated with the project to see if there are any weaknesses and if there are any threats to its viability.\nThere are many ways of assessing the potential risks to a project such as completing:\n\n* a risk register that identifies the potential risks to your project or organisation, the probability of them occurring, the likely impact on your project if the risk occurred, and the ownership and management of the risks identified.\n* a SWOT analysis is a list of all your organisation’s strengths, weaknesses, together with the opportunities and threats which you perceive in the external environment\n& a PEST analysis considers how you operate in the light of political, economic, social and technological developments.\n\nGood risk analysis and management is particularly important if your organisation has staff and volunteers, or takes on premises .\n## Financial risk\n\nManaging financial risk can be a difficult area for voluntary management committees. They are responsible for ensuring public money is used for public benefit, and for ensuring that the good name of their organisation is not tarnished by financial mismanagement or malpractice. Yet virtually any form of growth and development carries an element of risk, and failure to adapt to changing circumstances is a major risk in itself. With tight internal procedures and effective planning, unnecessary risks can be minimised, and risks necessary for growth and development can be managed with confidence and care.\n\nThe following explores some potential financial risks and looks at how they can be minimized.\n## Risk of fraud or mismanagement\n\nResponsibility for minimising this risk lies with voluntary management committee members, who must understand their financial responsibilities and:\n\n* ensure proper budgetary control as part of strategic management\n* ensure staff to whom financial authority has been delegated have sufficient skills and training to fulfil their remit\n* ensure effective procedural checks are embedded in day-to-day processes and are regularly reviewed. Many organisations develop a financial procedures manual and associated training for this purpose .\n\n## Risk of loss of income\n\nPlanning can alleviate this risk, for example:\n\n* diversifying income sources to minimise the impact if one source dries up. Consider not only a mix of funding sources but also of funding types. Also consider long-term risks to funding, and how you will prepare to address them\n* contingency planning for loss of specific funding, developing reserves\n* staggering funding applications and re-applications, to ensure that these do not all happen in the same year\n* managing fixed costs. If your operation is vulnerable to external change it is wise to keep fixed costs, such as permanent staff, low\n* planning for a flexible organisational structure that can scale up and down, as circumstances require.\n\n## Risk of unexpected costs\n\nSuch risks can often be transferred by taking insurance . It is important to check the terms of cover carefully, review all insurance annually and ensure cover is adequate for the level of risk for your organisation. Some kinds of insurance are compulsory, in particular buildings insurance and employers’ liability insurance. It may also be wise to insure:\n\n* volunteers\n* equipment – against fire, flood, theft\n* advice – to address the risk of legal action for negligent advice\n* key people – where you are depending on the skills of specific staff to carry through business plans and generate income.\n\n## Risks in your wider operating environment\n\nChanges in the law, change of government and social, environmental and economic change can all have a financial impact on your organisation. Such risks are best anticipated and managed through strategic planning.\n## Risks to the personal finances of the voluntary management committee\n\nThis is minimised by ensuring an appropriate organisational structure. If the financial risk is high, incorporation should be considered to limit liability.",

It should cover objectives and strategies, and enable the organisation to deliver more effectively. Business plans are as individual as the groups that develop them, but some common elements include:\n\n* the history and background of your organisation and current activities\n* future activities – what you are going to do and why?\n* when and how you are going to do it?\n* where will the money come from? When and how it will be spent?\n* how will you assess the potential risks to your project?\n* how will you keep track of your progress and spending? How will you monitor and review?\n* how will you know if the plan is working? How will you evaluate?\n\nRemember who you are writing the plan for: your management committee, your staff, members, clients. You should be honest and realistic when setting out your aims and objectives and how you intend to deliver them.\n\nThe information supplied in the ‘public version’ of a Business Plan may be slightly different to the version you will use for yourself. You should consider the information you supply to any third party carefully.\n\n## Who should be involved in the planning process?\nDepending on the size of the organisation, it is useful to involve a number – or all – key players in the development of the plan to varying degrees.

Exactly what you will need to do will depend on the scale of your operation, the legal status and whether or not it is a charity.\n\n## Your responsibilities\nYour voluntary management committee has a responsibility to report on the financial position of your organisation:\n\n* if your organisation is a charity or is incorporated, this is a legal requirement\n* if your organisation is not a charity and is unincorporated, the responsibility to report is more moral than legal. However, it is common for funders to require the production of proper accounts as a condition of funding.\n\nFind out more about [the implications of different legal structures](http://www.scvo.org.uk/setting-up-a-charity/decide-on-a-structure/).\n\n## Keeping records\nYour organisation should keep proper financial records throughout the year, with the end of year accounts normally produced at the end of a financial year. Many organisations use the public sector financial year (April-March), but an organisation can choose its own year, or can follow a different established one, eg, the European Union financial year (January-December).\n\nAccounting records must be kept for 6 years after the end of the financial year to which they refer.\n##Requirements on Scottish charities\n\nAll Scottish charities are required to prepare annual accounts consisting of numerical information and a Trustees’ Annual Report which is narrative information providing details that cannot be expressed in financial terms.\n\nThe Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) has [more information on annual accounts and annual reports](http://www.oscr.org.uk/).\n\n## External scrutiny\nWhether your organisation needs to have its accounts checked by someone depends on:\n\n* what your constitution says\n* if it’s a funding requirement\n* if it’s a regulatory requirement.\n\nUnder statutory requirements, Scottish charities’ accounts must be externally scrutinised – either by independent examination or audit. The type of external scrutiny depends on the charity’s governing document, gross income and net assets, and whether or not the charity is also a company.\n\nThe Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) has [more information on independent examination and audit](http://www.oscr.org.uk/).\n\n## Independent examination\nAn independent examination is an external review of accounts to determine whether they are a fair reflection of the underlying records for the period concerned. \n\nIn general, an independent examiner is an independent person who is reasonably believed by the voluntary management committee to have the ability and practical experience to carry out a competent examination of the accounts. This could be a banker or a lawyer, as well as an accountant. \n\nAn independent examination doesn’t have to be carried out by a registered auditor, and is likely to be much cheaper, or even free. \n\nYour local [Third Sector Interface](http://www.vascotland.org/)may be able to give contact information for Independent Examiners in your area.\n\nHowever, if a charity has an income up to a certain level, or prepares fully accrued accounts, then it must have an independent examination by a suitably qualified Independent Examiner. The Association of Charity Independent Examiners (ACIE) may be a useful place to start if you are trying to [find an Independent Examiner in your area](http://www.acie.org.uk/).\n\nAn independent examination is less rigorous and costly than an audit, with no opinion being expressed on the accounts.\n\n## Audit\nIn contrast to an independent examination, an auditor is required to build up a body of evidence and express a formal opinion on the figures contained in the annual accounts. \n\nUnder the 2006 Regulations, if the term ‘audit’ is used in a charity’s governing document, or it prepares fully accrued accounts, it must have its accounts audited by a registered auditor. \n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants Scotland (ICAS) has a [list of registered auditors in Scotland](http://icas.org.uk/).\n\nIf a voluntary organisation is a charitable company then they must prepare their accounts in a way that satisfies the requirements of both accounting regimes – company and charity. \n\nWhether they are required to have an audit or an independent examination is again dependent on income and what their governing document says.\n\nThe Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) has [more information on whether your charity accounts need an audit or an independent examination](http://www.oscr.org.uk/).\n\n## SORP & SOFA\nA SORP is a Statement of Recommended Practice. It provides recommendations on how accounting standards should be applied in the context of particular sectors and how to account for sector specific transactions. \n\nThe Charities SORP applies to charities generally in the UK, unless a more specific SORP applies (such as for the Further and Higher Education sector or Registered Social Landlords). \n\nSORP does not apply to charities preparing receipts and payments accounts, a choice available to those with annual income below £250,000.\n\nThe purpose of the SORP is to act as a guide to preparing and presenting a charity’s annual report and accounts, so that they conform with various legal requirements, and so that the accounts give a ‘true and fair view’ of the charity’s financial activities and financial position. \n\nThe SORP tries to get away from the concept of profit as the measure of success or failure. \n\nThe profit concept is not appropriate to charities, as charity law requires them to use all funds to further their charitable objects. \n\nThe profit and loss account (income and expenditure account) is therefore replaced by a Statement of Financial Activities (SoFA). \n\nThe SoFA brings together all the resources available to the charity and shows how these have been used to fulfil the charity’s objectives.\n",

You may, however, qualify for certain VAT reliefs and exemptions so it’s important to consider your VAT position and if it’s either necessary or beneficial (or both), to register for VAT purposes. [Visit the HMRC website for more information](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/).\n\nUK charities pay hundreds of millions a year in VAT, much of which can be legitimately reclaimed, but the rules on what can and cannot be recovered are numerous and complex. \n\nSCVO has a VAT and Tax Helpline service for SCVO members provided by Scott Moncrieff and Saffery Champness. \n\n## Corporation Tax\nLimited companies and unincorporated organisations are liable for Corporation Tax on their profits. This includes all charities, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are liable for Income Tax. However, there are a number of tax exemptions available to charities which mean that they usually do not pay Corporation Tax.\n\n## Capital Gains Tax\nCharitable status allows for exemption from payment of capital gains tax. Voluntary organisations without charitable status are not exempt from capital gains tax. \n\n## Business Rates\nBusiness rates are charges made by local authorities to support the provision of local services and are calculated with reference to the rateable value of the property as determined by the local Assessor. \n\nThe rateable value itself is based on the notional rental income obtainable for the property.\n\nBusiness premises occupied by a registered charity or registered community amateur sports club and used wholly and mainly for charitable purposes (e.g. an office or workshop) can apply to the local authority for relief from the unified business rate. \n\nCharities qualify for mandatory business rates relief of 80%. The remaining 20% may be (and often is) granted by the local authority; so it is possible for a charity to attain 100% relief from rates.\n\nA charity shop is eligible for mandatory rates relief of 80% provided it wholly or mainly sells donated goods, and the proceeds are reapplied for the charitable purposes of the charity. If the charity shop carries out trading in other ways (e.g. a purely for-profit café whose profits will eventually be donated to the charity) the position is likely to be different. \n\nVisit the [Charity Retail Association](http://www.charityretail.org.uk/resources.html) for more information.\n\nLocal authorities have discretion to give rates relief to non-charitable groups, including voluntary organisations, as they see fit.\n\n## Council Tax\nCouncil tax is a domestic property tax levied on property used exclusively for the purpose of living accommodation. \n\nThere is no specific relief for charities. \n\nThe occupier or owner of the property must rely on the general rules to take advantage of any exemption. Charities may therefore be able to get relief for a domestic property they own or rent depending on the number and nature of the people that live there. \n\n## Employment Related Taxes\nVoluntary organisations must ensure that proper payment of tax and other contributions are made with respect to employees and others. They should contact HMRC to obtain full information and assistance. \n\nAs with any other employer, voluntary organisations with staff with contracts of employment of any kind are required to apply the normal rules for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) by making deductions on behalf of HMRC (which deals with both tax and national insurance). Failure to do so may result in the employers being personally liable for uncollected tax.\n\nSessional workers who are employed to do a set amount of work during certain time periods over the year, with some form of unpaid gap in-between each one, are still liable to pay tax and national insurance as it is calculated on the amount of money they earn.\n\nIt is also important to establish whether a worker is employed by the organisation or is working for the organisation in a self-employed capacity. This is because self-employed people are themselves responsible for paying tax and NICs. \n\nIn most cases it will be pretty obvious, but if there is any doubt, [check the criteria published by HMRC](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/). This can be a complicated area of law and if an organisation has any doubts about a worker’s status they should seek professional advice. \n\nSCVO members can access further HR and employment law advice.\n\n## Volunteers\nVolunteers are just that, and should receive no payment at all for work done. They can receive reimbursement of legitimate expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation, provided they do not exceed the actual cost expended.\n\nA committee member of a charity or voluntary organisation is not liable for tax on expenses or benefits. However charity law in Scotland places restrictions on the payments and ‘benefits’ that can be given to ‘charity trustees’ (a term which would include directors of a charitable company) and charities should refer to these restrictions before making any payments or conferring any benefit. Visit the OSCR website for [more information on payment of trustees](http://www.oscr.org.uk/).\n\n## Gift Aid\nGift Aid is a way for charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) to increase the value of monetary gifts from UK taxpayers by claiming back the basic rate tax paid by the donor on the donation. It can increase the value of donations by a quarter at no extra cost to the donor. Gift Aid is worth nearly £1 billion a year to charities and their donors. \n\nSCVO has a VAT and Tax Helpline service for SCVO members provided by Scott-Moncrieff and Saffery Champness.",

        "en" : "# Trading\nTrading is an important source of funding for the third sector. \n\nIt can enable organisations to reduce their dependency on ever decreasing traditional funding sources, and can provide an independent, unrestricted and sustainable source of income. In addition, trading is much more than just a source of funding. It can also be a fundamental way in which an organisation achieves its charitable objectives or social/environmental mission.\n\nBut trading can also expose your organisation to risk – financial and reputational. \n\nIt requires trustees and employees to develop new skills, and can change the culture of your organisation. So before you decide to trade, you need to carefully consider a number of questions and take advice. \n\nA business plan is essential, and you should ensure there is a market for your proposed services or goods. \n\n## Can a charity trade?\nYes, even though trading is a commercial activity, charities can and do trade. The sale of goods and services now brings in half of the third sector’s income. \n\nTrading activities can range from the sale of goods such as Christmas cards, to the operation of cafes and training programmes, to delivering contract services for public bodies, eg for elderly or disabled people through Service Level Agreements.\n\nBut beware. First of all you must check whether your constitution allows you to trade. This is most important! \n\n## What about social enterprise?\nSocial Enterprise is not an organisational structure or registered status – it’s an activity. \n\nSocial enterprises can be charities and can have a range of legal forms including SCIO, company limited by guarantee, community interest company and industrial and provident societies. They generate a significant proportion of their income by selling goods and services, and are generally less reliant on grants and donations. They reinvest the profits they make in support of their social mission. \n\n## Are there any restrictions on charity trading?\nMany social enterprises, including community interest companies, are able to trade freely. But charity law imposes restrictions on the nature and level of trading activity charities can carry out, and some types of trading are subject to tax. There are different types of trading carried out by charities which have different legal and financial implications:\n\n* primary purpose trading\n* ancillary trading\n* non-primary purpose trading.\n\n## Primary purpose trading\nThis is trading which fulfils charitable objectives as set out in a charity’s constitution, eg\n\n* admission fees and tickets for theatre shows, museums and art galleries run by charities set up for these purposes\n* fees charged by an educational charity for training courses\n\nTrading where the work is carried out mainly by the charity’s beneficiaries is also primary purpose trading; for example, the manufacture and sale of goods by a charity which supports adults with learning difficulties\n\nPrimary purpose trading can generally be carried out by a charity without falling foul of charity law, setting up a separate trading arm, or having to pay corporation tax on the profits, provided the surplus is used to support the charity’s aims. \n\nBut you should always seek professional legal and financial advice, particularly with regard to VAT. \n\nYou can also [contact our free Tax and VAT service](http://www.scvo.org.uk/deal/tax-vat-service-members/). \n\n## Ancillary trading\nThis is trading which is a bi-product of a charity’s main activities, and though it does not carry out a primary charitable purpose, it contributes to its success. For example:\n\n* a café run by a charity which provides a theatre, museum or art gallery\n* books sold by a research or educational charity.\n\nAncillary trading enjoys the same tax benefits as primary purpose trading.\n\n**BUT BEWARE!**\n\nIf a charity run café provides refreshments to a member of the public not attending an event, then this is not considered to be ancillary trading, and would not be subject to tax exemption. \n\nHowever, if the café was used to support people working and volunteering there to develop new skills, experience, confidence, etc, and this was one of the charitable objects, then in this case the trade would be primary purpose trading.\n\nRemember, fundraising itself is not a charitable objective and fundraising alone cannot be considered as ancillary trading.\n\n## Non-primary purpose trading\nThis is trading which fulfils social objectives outside the charity’s main purpose and simply raises funds, eg a charity shop, when this is not linked to furthering charitable objects. \n\nThis is permissible providing it doesn’t involve any ‘significant’ risk to the resources of the charity, ie turnover should be sufficient to meet the costs of trading and not be financed out of the assets of the charity. \n\nThe profits from non-primary purpose trading are potentially subject to tax.\n\nWith non-primary purpose trading it is important to consider the scale of the risk to the charity. Whether this is ‘significant’, depends on a number of factors:\n\n* the size of the charity\n* the nature of the business\n* the expected cost\n* turnover projections.\n\nIf the trading activity could be considered ‘risky’ then the charity should establish a separate trading subsidiary in order to carry out the trade. \n\n## What is a trading subsidiary?\nA [trading subsidiary](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/tax/trading/subsidiary.htm) is a non-charitable trading company that can offer a solution to potential tax and charity law problems. Usually it is wholly owned by the charity. Because the trading subsidiary is not itself a charity, there are no limits on how it can trade and any commercial risks are restricted to a separate legal entity. Although the trading subsidiary’s profits will be liable to corporation tax, the trading subsidiary can usually donate all or most of its profits to the charity in a tax-efficient way.\n\n## Can the parent charity invest in the trading subsidiary?\nCharities may invest funds in a trading subsidiary by making a loan or donation, or purchasing shares, but charity trustees must be able to justify any financial support. Charities need to be very careful that it is an appropriate use of charitable funds to loan, donate or invest money in a trading subsidiary. Trustees should look at the financial viability of both the subsidiary and its proposed trading activity, and consider how long the investment will be tied up for. Trustees should get independent financial and legal advice.\n\n## Other tax exemptions – Small Scale Trading\nOther than primary purpose trading, there is also a useful exemption which applies to ‘small scale trading’. Non primary purpose ‘small-scale’ trading is trading which cannot be justified as primary purpose or ancillary, but if it poses no risk may avoid corporation tax, if it qualifies for ‘small scale exemption’. The details of this are complicated, and subject to annual turnover limits, so you should check with [HMRC](http://search.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/contactus/view.page?record=XqbRdlnT_mo). \n\n## Sale of donated goods\nSelling donated goods isn’t trading – it’s converting a donation into cash. HMRC does not normally regard the sale of donated goods by charities as trading so it can be carried out tax free, as long as the donations have been given to raise funds for the charity.\n\n## Useful links\n[HMRC Information on charities, and trading and business activities](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/guidance-notes/annex4/sectiona.htm)\n\n[Charity Commission: Trustees trading and tax: how charities may lawfully trade](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trustees-trading-and-tax-how-charities-may-lawfully-trade-cc35)\n\n[A guide to third sector trading from our sister organisation Wales Council for Voluntary Action](http://www.wcva.org.uk/media/8629/wcva__a_guide_to_third_sector_trading__e.pdf)\n\nBear in mind that certain aspects of charitable law may be different in Scotland.",

        "en" : "# Find your funds\nThe third sector has increasingly complex funding models and multiple income streams. Public sector support continues to fall and self-generated income is increasing in importance.\n\nYou should always seek as wide a diversity of funding sources as possible. Whilst grant funding is often the first port of call for third sector organisations, don’t forget that there are [other ways of raising money and generating income](other-sources.md).\n\nFunding available from the Lotteries,Trusts and Foundations, and government and the EU is extensive, but competition is intense. Research and preparation is the key.  You’ll find help here so you can consider if grants are the best option for you.\n\n## Lotteries\nThe National Lottery is the state franchised national lottery in the United Kingdom. A percentage of the proceeds are distributed to good causes through 12 independent organisations in the UK. In Scotland these are [Big Lottery Fund Scotland](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/scotland), [Creative Scotland](http://www.creativescotland.com/), [Heritage Lottery Fund](http://www.hlf.org.uk/), [sportscotland](http://www.sportscotland.org.uk/) and the [British Film Institute](http://www.bfi.org.uk/). Most programmes are competitive and it can be a lot of work to fill in an application for the major programmes. However the small grant funds such as [Awards for All](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/programmes/scotland/awards-for-all-scotland) are much simpler. Check the guidelines and make use of the support offered by the Lottery distributors, so you don’t waste your time with an inappropriate or incomplete proposal.\n\nThere are a number of other lottery programmes in the UK. [The Health Lottery](https://www.healthlottery.co.uk/) includes 51 local society lotteries which raise money for local health causes managed through the independent charity [The People’s Health Trust](http://www.peopleshealthtrust.org.uk/). The [People’s Postcode Lottery](http://www.postcodelottery.co.uk/Home.htm) provides grants distributed through the [People’s Postcode Trust](http://www.postcodetrust.org.uk/).\n\n## Trusts and Foundations\nGrants making trusts and foundations come in all shapes and sizes, founded for a variety of reasons, with different social and political perspectives, and with different grantmaking approaches. Identifying those that are worth approaching needs careful research. There are five main types of grant making trusts:\n\n* Individual/Family/Private Trusts – set up as a way for a wealthy individual or family to practice philanthropy. These trusts usually have a strong philosophy of giving based on the personal values, views and interests of the founder, eg [The Robertson Trust](http://www.therobertsontrust.org.uk/).\n* Institutional Trusts – founded from an act of Parliament, Royal Charter or Livery Company. eg [The Carnegie Dunfermline Trust](http://www.andrewcarnegie.co.uk/).\n* Governmental Trusts – set up by the government, or with a grant from the government, eg [The Voluntary Action Fund](http://www.voluntaryactionfund.org.uk/funding-and-support/) was set up with funding from the Scottish Government.\n* Corporate Trusts – established by companies transferring shares or capital to trustees to be used for charitable purposes, eg [Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland](http://www.ltsbfoundationforscotland.org.uk/index.asp?cookies=True). These can be independent from the company itself, or are controlled by the company with company personnel as the trustees.\n* Fundraising Trusts – these are trusts set up to raise funds and then distribute them to other charities, eg [Comic Relief (Red Nose Day)](http://www.comicrelief.com/) and [BBC Children in Need](http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/childreninneed).\n* Community trusts or foundations encourage philanthropy and strengthen the voluntary sectors in the countries, regions, and towns in which they operate. [Foundation Scotland](https://www.foundationscotland.org.uk/) is Scotland’s only community foundation and busiest grantmaker, making more awards to good causes than any other independent funder.\n\nFor more information on applying to trusts and foundations, see the next section on [making the ask](http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/finding-funding-make-the-ask).\n\n## Government Funding\nBudget cuts and spending reviews have made substantial changes to central and local government funding. Core funding has been cut, but many organisations have benefited from wider access to contracts as local authorities and the government recognise the key part the third sector can play in public service delivery. As with most funding, government funding programmes have firm deadlines for submitting applications, so you need to plan your programmes well in advance.\n\nThe main funding priorities of the Scottish Government reflect current policy objectives and are usually focused on national projects that benefit large numbers of people. Here are some of the currently available funds, contact the [Third Sector Unit](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/15300/Contacts) for further information.\n\n* [Community led regeneration and community empowerment](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Built-Environment/regeneration/communityfunds)\n* [Environmental projects](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/funding-and-grants)\n* [International Development](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/International/int-dev)\n* [Social care](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Support-Social-Care/Financial-Help/Adult-Community-Care-Grant-Scheme)\n* [People and communities](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Built-Environment/regeneration/community/pcf)\n* [Health](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Support-Social-Care/Financial-Help/16bGrants)\n\nMany quangos and non departmental public bodies also give funding to charities and voluntary organisations. Examples include:\n\n* [Creative Scotland](http://www.creativescotland.com/funding) distributes funding for the arts, screen and creative industries from the Scottish Government and the National Lottery.\n* [Historic Scotland](http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/grants.htm) provides a number of grants and funding schemes to support bodies and individuals in the protection, education and promotion of the historic environment.\n* [Scottish Natural Heritage](http://www.snh.gov.uk/funding/) provides funding to promote care for the natural heritage, wildlife, habitats, rocks and landscapes of Scotland.\n* [Sportscotland](http://www.sportscotland.org.uk/funding/funding/) provides funding for organisations involved in Scottish sport.\n\n## Local Authorities\nFunding from [local authorities](http://www.cosla.gov.uk/scottish-local-government) has significantly decreased in recent years and many grant opportunities have been turned into competitive tendering for contracts and service level agreements. But some local authority grants still exist and many local authorities also administer historic trust funds. Application processes for local authority funding can vary widely. Most local authorities will have the information and documents needed to apply for a grant on their website, and also provide funding support which may include funding searches, bulletins, events and training.\n\nYou should work to build your relationship with your local authority as you would with any other potential supporter. You may want to get a local councillor or local authority worker to sit as an ‘advisor’ on your board (non voting so as to avoid conflict of interests). They can alert you to where there is money, who to talk to, and how to navigate the system.\n\n## European Funding\nThe European Union provides a large amount of money for social and economic development in the Member States, a small part of which is available to third sector organisations. Getting money from Europe can be a difficult, slow and painstaking process, but is not impossible. It takes time, effort and persistence. There is increasing competition for the available funds, and the programmes, priorities and guidelines are constantly changing.\n\nMany EU funding programmes require match funding or partnerships of three or more organisations, and some call for cross-sectoral partners. The application process can be demanding, and if you do find partners, think carefully about your position. The lead partner will have to deal with the responsibility of project management and reporting.\n\nIf you’re successful make sure you have the right staff to financially manage the project, and don’t offer more than you can deliver. You must keep time sheets and document the progress of the project.\n\n* [The EU Funding Portal](http://www.funding-portal.eu/) is an online resource for Scottish organisations interested in EU funding.\n* Information about European funding is available on [the European Commission website](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm#funding)\n* [European Citizen Action Service](http://www.ecas.org/european-funding-guide-non-profit-sector/) produces an annual funding guide to help give organisations an overview of funds available.\n\n# Next step\n[Make-the-ask](/running-your-organisation/funding/step-by-step-guide/make-the-ask.md)",

        "en" : "# Get ready\nFundraising is often critical to the success of your organisation, and should be a long term carefully considered process.\n\nBut just because you need funding doesn’t mean you’re ready to start looking for it yet. As well as funders wanting evidence of need, they also want to know that your organisation is well managed and can provide good value for money.\n\nYou’ll find material here to help you think through the important things to do before you can fundraise effectively.\n\n## Show you’re organised\n\nTo reassure funders and supporters that you’re a responsible organisation you need a constitution **(http://www.scvo.org.uk/setting-up-a-charity)** which sets out your aims and objectives and the rules governing how your organisation is managed and run.\n\nIf you’ve already got a constitution you need to regularly review it to make sure it meets your needs, eg ensure you have the power to borrow money, set up a social enterprise, etc\n\nThink about obtaining charitable status **(http://www.scvo.org.uk/long-form-posts/setting-up-a-charity-faqs/#charitytofundraise)**. Some funders only give to registered charities and charitable status can give you more credibility with other donors as they know you’re complying with a minimum standard of accountability and governance.\n\nNote that fundraising itself is not a charitable purpose, instead it’s a way of enabling a charity to achieve its objectives.\nSum up your finances\n\nFinances and financial responsibility are the areas most scrutinised by funders. Before you start fundraising, you need to consider these financial issues:\n\n### 1. Bank Account \n\nYou should have a bank account **(http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/finance-business-management/bank-accounts/)** in the name of the organisation which offers the facility to have transactions approved by two people. This helps protect against fraud.\n\n### 2. Financial Management \n\nYou need to show your finances are well managed and produce regular [financial statements] **charity-accounts-financial-reporting.md** including management accounts, cash flow forecasts and an annual budget.\n\n### 3. Annual Report and Accounts\n\nYour annual accounts should be prepared and audited or examined in line with the requirements of your legal structure **(http://www.scvo.org.uk/setting-up-a-charity/decide-on-a-structure/)** and constitution. \n\nThe Trustees Annual Report is your opportunity to highlight your achievements and can act as a promotional tool for your organisation. It can also explain any surpluses, deficits or [reserves](/running-your-organisation/business-planning/reserves).\n\nIf you’re running at a deficit, you should have a plan to reassure funders that you will be able to eliminate it, and they will be funding your work rather than your overdraft.\n\n### 4. Surplus or Reserves \n\nFunders will want to know why you’re not spending your own funds first before coming to them. Explain any ‘committed surplus’ or ‘restricted funds (perhaps money savedfor a major capital expenditure). Funders will recognise that it’s good practice to have 3-6 months’ reserves against future uncertainty.\n\n## Know your people\n\nNext to finances, funders will want to know how well you are managed. The committee or board need to have the skills to manage the organisation well and have good governance practices. If you have staff you need to have good recruitment, and management processes. Volunteers are important too so show you value and look after them.\n\nFundraising has been described as part science and part art, but really, it’s all about people. Successful fundraising needs to involve the whole organisation, so ask your board, staff and volunteers about their contacts, skills and outside interests. You may be surprised at the list of people, businesses and organisations that can be used to build support.\n\n* local and regional conferences and seminars, e.g., [the Gathering](http://gathering.scot/), the Institute of Fundraising annual Scottish Conference.\n* training – there are lots of useful courses **(http://www.scvo.org.uk/events)** and good websites.\n\n## Prove your worth\n\nYour position in the community you work in, recognition and effectiveness are all important to funders. You may need to show funders evidence of community support. Include things like:\n\n* press articles highlighting your achievements\n* awards received by staff, volunteers or the organisation\n* community leaders sitting on the board\n* a record of financial contributions from individuals\n* cash / in-kind support from local business\n* statistics on the number of people accessing / receiving your services\n* recognition by government or other agencies\n* active volunteer base and membership numbers\n* positive testimonials from experts, clients, members and volunteers\n* case studies and stories from your beneficiaries\n* structured community consultations\n* list of fundraising events\n* feedback and evaluations from user / beneficiary groups\n\n## Plan to succeed\n\nIt’s important to have an overall organisational plan to fit your fundraising into. If you already have a [business plan](/running-your-organisation/business-planning/writing-business-plan), this is a good start. If you don’t have a formal plan, here’s a list you should be working on. You need to:\n\n### 1. Define the vision\n\nYour organisational vision is the ‘big picture’ – the reason why your organisation exists. This needs to be clearly defined.\n\n### 2. Mission statement\nWith your vision defined you can write your mission statement where you explain (in 50 words or less) what you are doing or planning to do about your vision. Use your objects of your organisation from your constitution and focus on what you want to achieve.\n\n### 3. Aims and objectives\nOnce you have your mission statement you can look at setting out your strategic aims – how you want to fulfil your mission, your overall priorities. Then you can set specific targets and time scales for each aim.\n\n### 4. Project outcomes/impact\nWith your aims and objectives clarified you then need to focus on what the projected outcomes, or impact of achieving these objectives will be. Outcomes or impact are the expected changes and / or benefits that will occur as a result of achieving the objectives. This is distinct from outputs, which are measurable and quantifiable activities that have occurred. Outcomes are what the funder wants to ‘invest’ in.\n\nOnly once you have these important foundations in place, can you think about a fundraising strategy. Analyse your position, look at your strengths and weaknesses, and what fundraising experience and resources you have. Identify the gaps. This is an integral part of your [business plan](writing-business-plan). Remember things change, so aim to review and update your strategy every year.\n\n# Next step\n[Find your funds](find-your-funds)",

        "en" : "# Jargon buster\nIt’s important when fundraising to write effective proposals and sell your project to a funder in language that the funder can understand. Here are some key words and phrases that funders use quite often.\n\n### Baseline data\nFacts about the characteristics of a target group or population and its context, ideally gathered before the start of a project.\n\n### Capital funding\nMoney for one-off purchases (e.g. equipment, building costs, materials).\n\n### Core funding\nDirect funding for the central support costs of your organisation including central overheads, often salaries, management / administrative staff costs\n\n### Development funding\nMoney for the internal infrastructure costs of an organisation to enable it to grow and develop.\n\n### Earned Income\nMoney that can come from membership fees, selling expertise, services, or products, rent (from other organisations using your premises), investments.\n\n### Full cost Recovery\nThis means that when you have costed a service you have included all the direct and indirect costs that can be reasonably attributed i.e. a proportion of rent, management salaries, IT and phones, evaluation and monitoring etc.\n\n### The Fundraising Standards Board\nThe regulatory body operating across the UK that benevolent bodies, including charities, may join. You can contact the FRSB to raise any concerns about fundraising, to ensure charities are accountable for their fundraising,  and to improve fundraising standards.\n\n### Impact\nBroader or longer-term effects of a project’s activities, outputs and outcomes.\n\n### Inputs\nResources put into a project to carry out an activity. Inputs may be human, material or financial, or can be expressed as time.\n\n### Institute of Fundraising\nHas Codes of Practice and guidance that cover most areas of fundraising\n\n### Intermediate outcomes\nSteps along the way to end outcomes. They are often smaller changes that need to happen before the final, desired outcome can be reached.\n\n### Loan finance\nSecuring a loan as an alternative to a grant – This is usually sought when there is clear potential for future earned income or there is a need to cover a gap in funding that is already secured.\n\n### Monitoring\nThe routine, systematic collection and recording of information about a project, mainly for the purpose of checking its progress against its plans.\n\n### Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator – independent regulator and registrar for Scottish charities.\n\n### Outputs\nAll the detailed activities, services and products you do or provide.\n\n### Outcomes\nThe changes, benefits, learning or other effects that happen as a result of your work.\n\n### Outcome indicators\nPieces of information that show whether expected outcomes have occurred.

        "en" : "# Make the ask\nIf you’re thinking about applying for a grant you can find help here to succeed.\n\n## Research\nWhen applying for grants it’s important to do your research – preparation is key. \n\n[Funding Scotland](http://www.fundingscotland.com/) has free, up to date and accurate information about over 1,000 sources of funds, with their application procedures and guidelines. Check the information carefully, see which projects the trust has previously funded, and how much has been donated. Call them to clarify anything you’re not sure of. \n\nThough many trusts say they give money UK wide, it’s important to find out if they have a track record of giving in Scotland before you apply. Try to find out what percentage of a trust’s overall expenditure actually goes to the area of work you are engaged in. Check the beneficial area, deadlines and any exclusions carefully.\n\nYou can get annual reports from organisations doing similar work to yours to see which trusts have supported them. Another source of information is law firms who administer local trusts. Try to get a lawyer on your board and ask them to use their contacts. You can get information on trusts’ charitable objectives, annual income and expenditure from [OSCR](https://www.oscr.org.uk/charities/search-scottish-charity-register) and the [Charity Commission](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/showcharity/registerofcharities/RegisterHomePage.aspx), and the latter also has downloadable annual reports of any grant making trust registered in England. Job ads often have the logo of the funder that paid for the position, so are worth a look.\n\nRemember that timing is important. Some trusts and foundations only meet on a quarterly basis, so plan ahead. Most trusts have a decision process which takes several months to receive, evaluate and decide on an application.\nIdentify Need\n\nFunders want to see evidence that your organisation or project idea serves a real need in your community (geographical, community, or community of interest).. You have to demonstrate what you do is important and show measurable results. In any analysis of community needs, you need to show:\n\n* what is the need you will be addressing? Who will benefit?\n* who else is working in this area? Can you collaborate and combine resources for greater impact, or will you be duplicating effort?\n* what is distinctive about your approach? How does your mission and values fit in with this?\n* what difference will you make? Are there solutions to the core problems, rather than addressing the immediate needs?\n* where will you target and what methods will you use to meet your targets?\n* what resources will you need?\n* how will progress be measured? What is the timeline?\n\n[Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics](http://www.sns.gov.uk/) provides information on health, education, poverty, unemployment, housing, population, crime and more.\n\n## Don’t chase the money\n\nAlways keep your mission a priority and the needs that are to be met – don’t just chase the money because it’s there. Never try to fit yourself into a funder’s criteria in order to get the grant. This will divert you from your core mission and your organisation will lose its sense of direction.\nWhy you?\n\nWhether you’re applying to a major foundation, or rattling cans in the street, your organisation needs to stand out from the crowd. Whoever you ask for money you need to answer these questions:\n\n* Why your organisation? What’s so important about what you will do or achieve with the donation?\n* How will you make a difference? What’s your solution?\n* How will you do it, what results will there be?\n* How will you measure your success?\n\n## Project versus core funding\n\nGenerally, most funders prefer to support projects and capital expenditure, rather than core and revenue costs. This can be a problem as core funding (eg salaries) is the money that enables you to do the actual projects. But you can break much of your work down separately and apportion staff time systematically across projects, so then you can feed back some of this money into your core costs.\n\nA project is a separate, specific and identifiable part of your work. It can be part of a larger activity, but it can be completed on its own. It has clear timescale and its own cost-centred budget related to the work to be done. But what makes a good project for you, and what makes a good project for the funder may differ. The following list is what most funders are concerned with:\n\n* it meets their funding guidelines and interests\n* it’s cost-effective and value for money\n* it has a realistic budget\n* it has measurable and quantifiable objectives and clear outcomes which can be evaluated and monitored\n* it’s exciting and innovative\n* it solves a real problem and meets a genuine proven need, and there’s evidence to back this up\n* it has a realistic timescale – a beginning, middle and end\n* it’s clearly related to your organisation’s core aims and objectives\n* it involves other organisations, shares resources and has a collaborative aspect\n* it doesn’t duplicate other services or fulfil statutory requirements that local or central government should be engaged in, unless it is a government funder\n\n## Writing Effective Grant Applications\n\nMost funders provide their own application form, but if not, this is how a typical proposal should be laid out:\n\n### 1. Title of project\n\nThis should be smart and eye-catching and describe the overall goal of the project.\n\n### 2. Introduction of organisation\n\nThis can be your mission statement if you have a good one. It should be short, include your charity number and state your legal structure such as a SCIO or company limited by guarantee. It should show how many years you’ve been in operation and whether you’re user led or are a membership based organisation. This helps the funder put the project in the context of the overall organisation.\n\n### 3. Executive summary of proposal (optional)\n\nThis is useful for a large or complex project. It can be a brief statement of the problem, what your solution is, and what the funding requirements are – it’s always better to ask for a specific stated amount rather than ‘a contribution towards’.\n\n### 4. The need or case statement\n\nThe most important part of your proposal clearly explaining why this project is necessary, what need you’re addressing, and how you know this is a need. This should align with the funder’s eligibility criteria, and is the place to back up your argument with facts and figures, case studies, and consultation and survey results. Be specific, and avoid overstatement and overly emotional appeals. Relate the need to the ‘big picture’ and identify its underlying causes. Highlight the social, environmental or economic costs of not meeting the need. Make your application stand out, show what is innovative about your work\n\n### 5. Description of project\n\nWhat are you delivering and when? Spell out the aims, objectives, and outcomes, methods, staffing / administration that will help clarify the budget. Don’t forget that [staffing can include volunteers](volunteers.md), and for many funders volunteer involvement can be counted as ‘in kind’ support. It’s important to keep a record of how many volunteer hours are given to your organisation, and there are [ways to measure the economic value of the work your volunteers do](http://www.volunteering.org.uk/component/gpb/is-there-any-way-of-measuring-the-economic-value-of-the-work-our-volunteers-are-doing).\n\n### 6. Evaluation and monitoring\n\nTie this section directly into your stated aims and objectives, and outcomes – as this is [what you will be evaluating](http://www.evaluationsupportscotland.org.uk/). Your [evaluation plan](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/funding/funding-guidance/managing-your-funding/self-evaluation) should be incorporated into the project proposal from the beginning and should be fully costed into the budget.\n\n### 7. Attachments/appendices – don’t send more information than you’re asked for. If the funder needs to know more, they will ask.\n\n### 8. Exit strategy\n\nMost trusts either make one-off grants or give regular support for only a limited period. Your application needs to be clear about the long-term goals and funding strategy of the project. Be clear what will happen when the funding runs out. Is there a strategy for obtaining continuing funding orcan the project become financially sustainable? Long term sustainability is increasingly important to funders.\n\n### 9. Conclusion\n\nSay what will happen if the need isn’t met, and sum up your main points again. Restate your funding requirements and indicate who else is funding you, how much you have already and who else you plan to ask. Funders like to know where they fit into the overall picture.\n\n### 10. Budget\n\nThis can be a separate attachment or part of the main proposal. Make sure you do your research. Get a selection of quotes, be realistic and make sure you check your calculations! If you under cost your project you may put your organisation into deficit. Some common mistakes include omitting:\n\n* National Insurance contributions, yearly salary increases and pension costs\n* Advertising, recruitment and training costs\n* Additional insurance, equipment and administration costs\n* Travel and accommodation for conferences, meetings, training.\n\nIf you’re taking on a new member of staff you may find this **sample budget useful** (Word download) (http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sample-Budget-for-a-New-Member-of-Staff.docx).\n\nFunders want to see good value so you may need to give three quotes for capital items.\n\n## What if you’re unsuccessful?\n\nIf you’re turned down by a trust, try to find out why. It may give you clues as to any weakness in your approach, and let you know if it’s worth applying again\n\n# Next step\n[Success and sustainability](sucess-and-sustainability.md)",

        "en" : "# Other sources\n\nThere’s a lot of pressure on the third sector to become less dependent on grants and look at other ways of fundraising and generating income. In this section we look at ways to make your funding sources as diverse as possible.\n\nJump to sections on:\n\nIndividual and community giving\n\nCompanies\n\n## Income generation, contracts and loans\n\nThere are many ways the third sector can generate its own income by the sale of products, services and expertise, eg:\n\n* renting out building space\n* providing a service under contract, eg for a local authority\n* charging users of a service for providing that service\n* selling items made by beneficiaries of the organisation\n* providing consultancy and training\n* selling gifts to members and supporters, eg Christmas cards, badges, t-shirts\n* running conferences and events\n* selling publications and undertaking research\n* running a charity shop to turn donated gifts into cash\n* getting the commission from selling products such as insurance.\n\nIncome generation can bring a number of advantages. It can:\n\n* give you the freedom to spend the proceeds in a way that suits you, so you can fund less popular aspects of your work that funders may not prioritise.\n* create a more robust and sustainable organisation, and improve the quality of your services\n* take the pressure off fundraising, or improve your prospects with funders who you can impress with the variety of your income streams\n* create new opportunities to borrow funds.\n\nSome organisations are better placed than others to explore income generation. You may have products that arise from your mission, or you may already be service based and have partnerships with local authorities to which you can sell your services. But if this is a new area for you, make sure you do a feasibility study and full risk assessment. Find out about the competition and get advice from other similar organisations. Any activity that involves trading may have **legal and tax implications** (link to finance section), and you need to check your **governing document** (link to governing doc section) allows you to carry out these activities.\n\nSome trading activities may mean a separate trading company should be set up. This is tax-effective, as the profits of the trading company can be [gift-aided](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-essentials-legislation/tax-effective-giving/gift-aid/gift-aid-for-charities/) to the parent charity. Also keeping this income generation work separate can help prevent your organisation getting diverted from its main mission and losing sight of its priorities. Seek professional advice on how best to structure your trading.\n\nRunning a successful [social enterprise](http://thirdforcenews.org.uk/blogs/the-difference-between-a-charity-and-a-social-enterprise) requires different skills and attitudes than most third sector organisations are used to. Sales and contracts have to be won and costs have to be recovered from income. Marketing and selling replace fundraising as key functions, so you’ll probably need additional trustees and staff with expertise in new areas. Success will depend on entrepreneurial ability as well as good management skills.\n\nIf you contract out your services, beware of penalty clauses for non-performance, and make sure you get enough money to cover all your costs. This is known as full cost recovery, where the pricing of contracts and the fees charged reflect the full cost of delivering the service, including a reasonable allocation of overhead costs.\n\nYou’ll need financial support for your new enterprise. It may be possible to use some of your reserves to invest in income generation. If it’s a commercial, rather than a charitable activity, then make sure you get an independent assessment of risk and return on the money. You could also think of borrowing the money if your **constitution** (link to setting up a charity) allows it. There are a growing number of sources (including some grant giving trusts and **ethical banks** - link to bank accounts) that now specialise in lending to the third sector and have experience in supporting social enterprise.\n\nLoans can allow your organisation to do today what might otherwise take years. More flexible than some other types of funding, loans take less time to arrange and require less onerous reporting and monitoring. The lender will want to see a **business plan** [link to http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/finance-business-management/business-and-strategic-planning/) and marketing strategy, and they will examine the organisational capacity to take on any new activity. As a legal agreement is being entered into, you’ll need the full agreement of your board.\n\nHere are some organisations that can help:\n\n[Scottish Enterprise](www.scottish-enterprise.com)\n\n[Senscot](www.senscot.net)\n\n[Social Enterprise Scotland](www.socialenterprisescotland.org.uk)\n\n[Social Firms Scotland](www.socialfirms.org.uk)\n\n[Social Investment Scotland](www.socialinvestmentscotland.com)\n\n[The School for Social Entrepreneurs](www.the-sse.org)\n\n[UnLtd](www.unltd.org.uk)\n\n## Individual and community giving\n\n(Individual and community giving)[https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-publications/caf-ukgiving2014] can provide a significant income source that organisations can use to support core and running costs. Though often overlooked as an income source by small organisations because people have difficulty in directly asking for support, there are a number of ways people can give.\n\n### 1. Donations\n\nFirst rule is – make sure they’re tax-effective.\n\n[Gift Aid](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-essentials-legislation/tax-effective-giving/gift-aid/gift-aid-for-charities/) adds additional ‘free’ money from the government at no extra cost to the donor\n\n[Payroll Giving](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-essentials-legislation/tax-effective-giving/payroll-giving/payroll-giving-for-charities/) allows employees to have charitable donations deducted from their salary before tax, so the charity gets more, and it costs the donor less\n\nIndividuals can also gift shares, securities, property and other assets. See HMRC for more details on any tax implications.\n\n### 2. Membership or Friendship Schemes\n\nThese can provide unrestricted and ongoing income, help develop wider support, and create opportunities for further fundraising. You need to check your **constitution** allows for this, and it won’t always be tax effective as there are restrictions on the level of benefit that can be received by the member. But whilst they may not generate a lot of income these schemes can enhance your credibility and campaigning ability.\n\n### 3. Direct mail and Telephone Appeals\n\nPopular and traditional techniques that can also inform potential supporters about your organisation. Make sure you follow the [Institute of Fundraising guidance](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/code-of-fundraising-practice/sections/telephone/).\n\n### 4. Face to face\n\nThis method of fundraising and [collections](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-disciplines/community-and-volunteer-fundraising/charitable-collections/) can be particularly effective. Make sure you have the right permissions and follow regulations and legislation.\n\n### 5. Legacies\n\nThe largest source of voluntary income to the sector, but clearly a sensitive issue. See the [Institute of Fundraising advice](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-disciplines/legacy-fundraising/) on how to ensure best practice standards are met.\n\n### 6. Churches, other faith groups and local clubs\n\nSome religions have set up charitable arms to give to projects that serve their membership and others give directly through the congregation. Also there are many clubs in every community ranging from the [Rotary](https://www.rotary.org/myrotary/en/search/club-finder) to the local [Women’s Institute](http://www.swri.org.uk). These social and business groups often raise money for local charities and can also provide local influence and support. The best approach here is through personal contacts, look to your board, supporters and volunteers to make contact with these groups.\n\n### 7. Schools\n\nMany schools will choose a charity to raise funds for, and some make connections through the curriculum. Providing information packs about the issues your organisation works with, and contacting the Head teacher and staff is a way in. If you’re working with children it’s essential to think about legal, ethical and safeguarding issues.\n\n### 8. Other charities\n\nMany fundraising charities are also grant givers, eg [Age Scotland](http://www.ageuk.org.uk/scotland/about-us/our-work/community-services/age-scotland-grants-programme/) It’s useful to develop networks with other charities doing similar work to your own. Find out who may fund what you are doing, and explore the option of joint funding projects.\n\n### 9. Events\n\nThey can be time consuming with small return for a lot of effort, and the need to spend money upfront to prepare. But events can provide unrestricted income, help raise your profile, attract new supporters, and give you a chance to promote your work to a wider audience. Here are some of the things you need to ensure your event works well and makes a profit:\n\n* reliable and committed volunteers\n* local business and community support\n* a creative and fun theme, and enough time for proper planning\n* a record of who attends – so you can contact them later and build up a base of longer-term support, not just one-off contributors.\n\n[Check your legal position](http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/legislation-regulation/) and whether you need appropriate licenses, eg for food safety and trading, raffles and lotteries, and serving alcohol. Check out local authority, police and fire notifications, venue occupancy levels, insurance provision, VAT liability, and make sure you’ve got adequate staff, bad weather contingency plans, and have considered traffic and parking. The Institute of Fundraising has a lot of [useful information on event fundraising](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-disciplines/event-fundraising/).\n\n### 10. Digital fundraising \n\nAn increasingly important source of fundraising as well as a great way to connect with and engage audiences and potential supporters. [New funding opportunities](http://knowhownonprofit.org/funding/digital-fundraising) are springing up all of the time. Here are some to think about:\n\n* Your website – you should have a clear donation button and option to download membership and donation forms for those who would rather not donate online.\n* [Email and social media](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/library/fundraising-using-email-and-social-media/)\n* Text donations via mobile phone\n* [Crowd Funding](http://www.ukcfa.org.uk/faqs), where a large number of people back an idea by putting in relatively small amounts of money\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) – where you can generate interest in your work, events, draw in new potential members, and raise your profile with a new audience\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/) – enables you to share photos and videos that highlight your work\n* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/) – enables you to engage supporters, share news and advertise jobs\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) – enables you to share information and news about your organisation, engage supporters and build relationships\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) – enables you to share videos that highlight your work\n* Company websites – where visitors are encouraged to click through to trigger a donation from the company.\n* [Google Ad Grants](http://www.google.co.uk/grants/) which gives nonprofit organisations an advertising allowance to promote their work on Google search pages\n* Traditional fundraising methods like auctions, raffles and paid advertising can be adapted to your website. [Ebay](http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/selling-nonprofit.html) has a dedicated part of its operations for charities\n\nFundraising through individuals can be time intensive. You need to cultivate, recognise and reward your supporters. [The Institute of Fundraising](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-disciplines/individual-giving/) has information on individual giving. Here are our top tips:\n\n* Do your research so you’ve got as much information as possible and can target your message\n* Make sure you have the right people doing the asking\n* Establish a budget, and a goal for donations\n* Thank each donor personally and take care of them\n* Keep records, so you can claim Gift Aid and also go back to them\n* Evaluate the campaign\n\n## Companies\n\n[Giving by companies](https://www.cafonline.org/giving-as-a-company/companies-newsletter/autumn-2014/corporate-giving-by-ftse-rises) can be difficult and time-consuming, and you need to decide your ethical policy before making any approach. Check that a company’s business values or practices don’t conflict with what your organisation stands for.\n\nLook at the business news and your local and regional press for information on local businesses. Your local [Chamber of Commerce](http://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/chambers/chamber-listing) can help you find out which companies operate in your area. Research is key in finding out how a company decides who to support. Check if there are any published guidelines on the company’s website, or try to make a good match of your project to a company’s products and services, or their customers’ interests.\n\nCompanies can provide support in a variety of different ways:\n\n* through grant making trusts which channel the company’s donations\n* cash donations through local branches and national headquarters\n* [Payroll Giving](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-essentials-legislation/tax-effective-giving/payroll-giving/payroll-giving-for-charities/) allows employees to have charitable donations deducted from their salary before tax, so the charity gets more, and it costs the donor less\n* matching money raised/donated by employees for your organisation\n* sponsorship of an event, award scheme, project or publication\n* Cause Related Marketing (CRM) where a company’s services and products can gain kudos by being associated with your cause. This is usually arranged through PR and advertising agencies, but could be tried on a smaller scale with a local company\n* through buying advertising space in programmes and publications\n* donations of products, eg computers, stationery, food products, raffle prizes, discount vouchers. [InKind Direct](http://www.inkinddirect.org/) facilitates the donation of unused/surplus goods from businesses to charities and voluntary organisations\n* Provision of facilities and services, eg printing, catering, transport, meeting rooms, venues for events\n* Personnel expertise to help with legal, financial, marketing, HR, managerial or planning, either through secondments or volunteers from their workforce\n* Running internal events to raise funds on your behalf eg company challenges, marathons, bake sales\n\nThe key issue for smaller charities is to be realistic about how company support can benefit you, and how much time and energy you may have to expend for a small return. Start with smaller, local businesses. Personal contact is always the most effective so use your networks to find out who the most relevant person is to contact in the company.\n\nIf you get support make sure your obligations are clear, on reporting requirements and whether you have to show the company’s logo, etc. Don’t forget to thank the company, and report back on the difference the donation has made. Send them your annual report and continue to nurture the relationship!",

        "en" : "# Success and sustainability\n\nIf you are lucky enough to secure funding it’s important to say thank you to your funders which may help you develop a long term relationship.  Read any conditions of grant and find out how the funder wishes to be acknowledged and recognised.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThere are a number of ways to develop the art of saying thank you and develop relationships with funders:\n\n* An immediate letter of acknowledgement and thank you is key\n* A telephone thank you by a board member can be useful and effective as it provides them with positive feedback on what they are doing and gives them direct contact with funders\n* Send funders your newsletter and annual report. Lists of funders should be included in your annual report and your website.\n* Solicit feedback from funders so they know you value their opinions. Communicate regularly to build a rapport. Invite them along to events and to meet beneficiaries.\n\n## Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nMonitoring and evaluation is important not just for building long-term relationships with your funders, but also for the effectiveness of your organisation. The information you gather can be used to inform future funding bids. Evaluate your efforts and look at your outputs and impacts:\n\n* How many people have you helped?\n* What impact have you made?\n* How have you changed people’s lives?\n* Have you shifted attitudes?\n* How has society benefitted from the work?\n\nDon’t just look at the amount of funding raised, look at the time and effort involved, and the possibility of repeating the activity. This will help you measure the process efficiently, control costs, generate more income and supporters, and retain these supporters. Then you can see what does and doesn’t work and develop new and better fundraising techniques. Formal monitoring and evaluation is very important to grant funders, so think about how you will gather this information right from the start of your project. Further support is available from [Evaluation Support Scotland](http://www.evaluationsupportscotland.org.uk/) and [The Big Lottery Fund](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/funding/funding-guidance/managing-your-funding/self-evaluation)\n\nCheck any specific terms or conditions of the grants are met. If certain aspects of the project haven’t worked, be truthful and transparent and show how you have learned from your mistakes. If you can’t use the money for the purpose it was requested, then notify the funder. You can suggest an alternative use for the donation, or will have to return the money if they don’t agree to this.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWhen the funding is finished what will happen to the project? If it’s a capital project, how will you maintain it in the future? If you want to continue you’ll have to find other sources of funding or support, and approach them at least nine months before the project runs out of funds to ensure continuity of funding. Consider if there’s scope for charging fees or [ways of earning income](http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/finance-business-management/trading/) from the activity, rather than becoming totally dependent on another grant.\n\nRead our guide to finding [other sources of funding](http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/finding-funding-other-sources).",

        "en" : "# Developing your board\nYou can’t sit a group of people around a table and assume that they will automatically become a highly effective governing body. You need to create a culture that grows good governance and enables your trustees to work together as a team.\n\n## What is expected of individual trustees?\nThere are five key elements that describe the core remit for individual trustees:\n\n1. Know and understand the duties and activities required to fulfil the role, including the legal obligations that underpin them\n2. Actively contribute to the work of the governing body, prepare for, and participate fully in, meetings, training, planning sessions and reviews.\n3. Give each other support and help, and do whatever possible to manage differences constructively.\n4. Seek to have constructive and respectful communication and coordination with staff and volunteers, and when necessary use the appropriate 5. Act with integrity, avoid conflicts of interest, and be worthy of the trust invested in the role by ensuring that all decisions are made solely in the interests of the organisation.\n\n## What do trustees want?\nOnce you’ve found the right people, you want to keep them. This is a two way process of both giving and getting. Trustees are required to give much, with no material reward, so it’s important they receive something in return. Examples of what they look for include:\n\n* opportunities to develop skills and learning\n* the chance to apply existing skills and experience to a new situation\n* the opportunity to influence the development of something they feel passionate about.\n\nSo it’s important to know what motivates your trustees when devising a development plan for them.\n\n## Enhancing board capacity\nDevelopment of the capacity of the governing body should include opportunities for individuals to learn or improve skills and abilities as members of the board, eg in chairing or reading financial reports. It should also identify activities that will contribute to the development of greater competence and effectiveness from the governing body as a whole, eg teamwork or staying up to date with changes to legislation.\n\n## Governance Manual\nA governance manual can assist in the development and overall effectiveness of your board. It may contain some or all of the following depending on the nature of the organisation, its work and size, and should be kept up to date:\n\n* brief history/background of the organisation\n* contact details of trustees and key personnel\n* calendar of meetings and key events\n* copy of the governing document\n* the mission statement\n* organisational chart\n* statement of the roles and responsibilities of trustees\n* policy and procedures for monitoring and evaluating the performance of trustees\n* policy and procedures for trustee development and training\n* terms of reference for meetings and any sub-committees\n* code of conduct **(download Word file)**\n* copy of the latest accounts, annual report and board minutes\n* current project income and expenditure statements or budget\n* procedures for payment of expenses\n* procedure for declaring register of interests **(download Word file)**\n* copy of the personnel manual and other relevant policies.\n\n## Building Skills and Experience\nThere are core skills relevant to every governing body. They should be able to:\n\n* think and act strategically\n* devise and implement a planning process\n* analyse financial information and set out the main [financial policies and procedures](content/running-your-organisation/finance-business-management.md)\n that the governing body will need to establish\n* set financial and other targets and [monitor and evaluate](http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/communitylearninganddevelopment/support/selfevaluation/hgiotso/index.asp) performance against those targets\n* identify and draw upon a broad range of knowledge and skills as required, eg marketing, project management, employment law.\n\n## Review\nGoverning bodies should have an annual cycle of planning and review. This cycle is often linked to annual returns to regulators, end of year accounts, and appraisals of volunteer and staff performance. An opportunity for the trustees to review their own performance should also be included in the cycle. There are various tools and processes that can be used to support a review:\n\n### Audit\nA board audit can help to identify areas of weakness, where improvement is necessary or even critical. Factors to be measured might include:\n\n* Regular attendance at meetings and participation in sub-committees\n* Understanding of roles and responsibilities and the work of the organisation\n* Participation in discussions and decision making\n* Having the skills, knowledge and understanding to provide effective scrutiny and monitoring.\n\nThis kind of performance review should be part of the culture of your organisation and undertaken regularly.\n\n### Away Days\nA well-structured review day can be a highly effective tool for identifying success and achievement, as well as areas that require attention and improvement. Areas to look at include:\n\n* attainment of current objectives and targets\n* strengths and weaknesses of the organisation\n* current plans’ contribution towards long-term aims\n\nGood governance needs well informed and active trustees.

      "_running-your-organisation_governance_meetings" : {
        "en" : "# Meetings\nMost of a governing body’s work is carried out through meetings. \n\nYour governing document will usually outline the type of meetings your organisation will have and their frequency. \n\nIn this section we look at how to ensure these meetings are as effective and efficient as they can be.\n\n## Board meetings\nHeld to make the main decisions of the organisation where only trustees can vote. Board meetings should be regular (4-10 per year) and well planned to ensure effective decision making. Before holding a meeting it’s important to:\n\n* clarify its purpose\n* decide who’s attending and who’s running the meeting\n* work together, listen and manage differences constructively\n* ensure that the agenda is useful and that clear minutes are produced.\n\nBoard meetings should not be taken up with reporting on past activities and work, they should focus on setting the strategic direction and development of your organisation in the future.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\nFor organisations with a membership, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) is the main way for the members to influence the governing body. Firstly by electing them, and secondly by passing resolutions that influence how or what they do. The AGM is also the main opportunity for the trustees to report on their activities and be held to account for them by the membership.\n\nMany voluntary organisations hold an AGM to fulfil a legal and/or constitutional obligation. An AGM provides an opportunity for members or beneficiaries to review the organisation’s financial position; with discussion of the accounts relating to the previous year.\n\nIt’s important for an organisation’s governing document to include the procedures for elections and AGMs. It should outline the business to be dealt with at the AGM, who may attend, who may vote, the information to be sent out in advance, and a whole range of procedural issues.\n\n## AGMs and Incorporated Organisations\nSince the Companies Act 2006 came into force, there’s no longer a statutory requirement to hold an AGM. But many companies still do for a number of reasons:\n\n* an AGM must be held if it specifically states in the company’s articles that one is required\n* an AGM can be an important opportunity for members who have minimal contact with directors to question directors about the company’s performance and prospects. This can be a positive PR opportunity.\n\nUnlike a company a **[SCIO](http://www.scvo.org.uk/setting-up-a-charity/write-your-constitution/scottish-charitable-incorporated-organisation/)** is obliged to hold a meeting of members at least every 15 months.\n\n## Extraordinary or special general meetings (EGM and SGM)\nThese are called to discuss ‘one-off’ business items that may occur between AGMs. As well as being called by trustees, they can also requested by members if they feel the organisation is not being well run. The governing document will usually set out the number of full members required to request an EGM, and how this should be done.\n\n## Sub-committees\nSub-committees can be set up to tackle detailed planning or policy development in a specific area, eg finance or employment. But any decisions made by subcommittees need to be approved by the whole governing body. Sub-committees tend to fall into two categories – long-term, eg finance, staffing, and short-term, eg fundraising, events. They can provide an excellent opportunity to involve other people from within and outside the organisation, and can be useful for potential new trustees. To ensure that everyone knows what’s going on, every sub-committee needs up-to-date terms of reference that clearly describe its:\n\n* remit or purpose\n* membership\n* responsibilities and powers\n* reporting procedures\n* relationship to the governing body.\n\n## Agenda\nAn agenda is a list of things to be done and running order for a meeting. It should be prepared in advance, and is usually drafted by the Secretary in consultation with the Chair. Information sent to the governing body should be timely and relevant. Common agenda items include:\n\n* title, date, time and venue of meeting\n* people present and any apologies for absence\n* minutes of previous meeting for approval\n* actions relating to previous meeting\n* declaration of any conflicts of interest\n* items to be discussed and decided\n* reports from staff or sub-groups\n* financial matters\n* any other business (AOB)\n* date, time and venue of next meeting.\n\n## Minute Taking\nMinutes are a permanent record of when the meeting occurred, the main points of the discussions, decisions taken and actions required, by whom and when. Usually the responsibility of the Secretary, they should be approved by all and signed off by the Chair at the beginning of the following meeting. Minutes are legal documents, and could be requested by statutory bodies, for example during an investigation by an Employment Tribunal. It’s important that they are appropriate, concise and accurate. Copies should be sent to all trustees, with the originals kept in a secure but accessible place.\n\n## Financial Reporting\nAll trustees have a collective responsibility for the organisation’s financial management, not just the Treasurer. Organisations with charitable or company status must follow the relevant regulations on financial reporting carefully. Financial reporting **(download sample financial policies and procedures)** is an important agenda item and should inform trustees of the organisation’s current and projected financial situation. Trustees must also be aware of all the tax, insurance and legal implications of their actions.\n\n## Code of Conduct\nMany organisations adopt a formal code of conduct **(download sample in Word format)** and a register of interests **(download sample in Word format)**, setting out the behaviour and conduct expected of trustees. This can be a useful reference if things go wrong. In order to fulfil their duties, trustees should uphold certain values and principles. These include to:\n\n* act at all times in the best interests of the organisation, ahead of any professional or personal interest\n* act in accordance with the organisation’s governing document and any relevant legislation\n* act with honesty and integrity, and respect confidentiality and diversity of opinion\n* enhance the organisation’s reputation and take an active interest in its work\n* uphold the values and principles of the organisation\n* maintain good relationships with other trustees and with staff, volunteers, members and other people in the organisation\n* actively contribute to the work of the board by regularly attending meetings and preparing and participating in discussion and decision-making.\n\nGood governance needs well informed and active trustees.

        "en" : "# Recruitment and induction\nRecruiting trustees is a vital part of what you do. Once you’ve got them, make sure they are given a thorough induction.\n\n## Check your governing document\nThe first trustees are likely to be drawn from the group who set up the organisation. After that, the trustees will, and should, change over time with some people leaving and some new members joining. This provides a healthy process for fresh ideas, new skills and outside energy to come in, and prevents the organisation going stale. This turnover should be planned, and your governing document should detail who can be a trustee, how they’re elected, how long they can be in office, and whether they are eligible for re-election if they wish to continue.\n\n## Where are the gaps?\nBefore you look for new trustees you should see what skills your current board has, and identify where there are any gaps with a [skills audit](https://reachskills.org.uk/knowledge-centre/support-boards/recruiting-and-retaining-trustee/how-do-i-do-skills-audit). Work out what you will need now and in the future, and what you’re looking for in a new trustee. Prepare a job description or profile of the skills, experience and knowledge required, and some background information on your organisation.\n\n## Mix it up\nRecruitment procedures should be open and transparent to ensure the best possible mix of skills, knowledge, attitudes and experience. Use [Goodmoves](http://www.goodmoves.org.uk/Search/CMS), your local [Third Sector Interface](http://www.vascotland.org/), [Volunteer Scotland](http://www.volunteerscotland.net/) and social media in your search.\n\n## Selection and Election\nAny potential candidates need to have their eligibility checked. Meet them to find out whether they’ll be a good fit for your organisation. If they’re willing to join you, take up references and ask for proof of identity and qualifications. Ask them to sign a Sample Consent Form and Declaration, then make sure they’re elected in line with the rules in your governing document.\n\n## Co-option\nCo-option is a way of bringing someone onto your governing body at any time, where the usual process would involve an election at the AGM. Your governing document should indicate whether co-opted members have a vote. You should minute the nature of the role so that there is no confusion or misunderstanding in the future.\n\n## Finding a Chair\nThe role of the Chair is crucial, and the selection, election or appointment needs to be open and transparent. Some organisations recruit their Chair from existing trustees, others seeks to recruit someone who can bring specific skills and experience to the role. Your governing document should describe how your Chair is selected.\n\n## Induction\nA good induction **(download sample Word file)** is vital for new trustees. \n\nThey should:\n\n* Know about the organisation and its aims, and understand the challenges it faces and the support they can expect\n* understand their role and responsibilities, and any personal liabilities\n* visit your organisation and get the opportunity to meet with existing trustees, staff, volunteers, beneficiaries and service users\n* understand what expenses they can claim.\n\nThe induction pack should include a copy of the governing document, accounts, previous minutes. You should make sure your new recruits understand these key documents. \n\nTrustees need to play a full part in discussions and decision making. A good induction will set the groundwork for future development and learning. Think about having an existing trustee mentor a new one, and make sure you continue to develop your board. Review the induction process with your new trustees after six months, to ensure that their knowledge and understanding is as it should be.\n\nGood governance needs well informed and active trustees.

      "_running-your-organisation_governance_roles-responsibilities" : {
        "en" : "# Roles and responsibilities\nMembers of governing bodies go by a variety of names – ‘Trustees’, ‘Management or Executive Committee Members’ or ‘Directors’. The name depends on your legal status, governing document and custom and practice. If you’re registered as a company, you’ll have a ‘Board of Directors’. If you’re a charity, it will be ‘Trustees’. The title matters little. What’s more important is that the individuals involved are familiar with the duties and liabilities associated with their role.\n\n## What should the governing body do?\nTrustees are there to lead, control and supervise the organisation’s activities. It’s the part of the organisation with formal power and responsibility, which are detailed in the governing document, and backed up by law. If things go wrong, it’s the trustees that will be called to account. They need to be aware of this and act in the best interests of the organisation and its beneficiaries, following all requirements of law and regulation. This is sometimes referred to as the need for ‘due diligence’.\n\nTo enable the organisation to meet its aims, trustees should perform the following functions:\n\n* Set and maintain the vision, mission and values of the organisation.\n* Develop direction, strategy and planning.\n* Ensure the organisation has the structure and resources for its work.\n* Establish policies and procedures to govern organisational activity, including guidance for the board, volunteers and staff.\n* Establish systems for reporting and monitoring.\n* Manage risk.and ensure compliance and accountability with the governing document, external regulators and the law.\n* Make certain that the financial affairs of the organisation are conducted properly and are accurately reported.\n\n## Who can join a governing body?\nThere are no specific legal restrictions to who can be a management committee member of an unincorporated voluntary association that doesn’t have charitable status. Any prohibitions kick in when an organisation either incorporates (becomes a company) and/or gets charitable status.\n\n### Incorporation\nCompany directors have to be over the age of 16. You can’t be a company director if you’re an undischarged bankrupt or disqualified by a court from holding a directorship, unless given leave to act in respect of a particular company or companies.\n\n### Charitable Status\nYou can’t be a charity trustee if you’re an undischarged bankrupt, or have an unspent conviction for dishonesty or an offence under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. Other disqualifications include being removed under either Scottish or English Law or the courts from being a charity trustee, or a person disqualified from being a company director. For more information see the OSCR ‘Guidance for Charity Trustees’. In addition people who have committed a serious offence against children may be disqualified as trustees.\n\nAs well as these legal considerations, there are other things to think about when looking at who can be a trustee. You should think about the age and capabilities of your trustees and the composition of your board.\n\n### Regulation\nIt’s the responsibility of all trustees to ensure that the organisation fulfils its obligations to its regulators, eg OSCR, Companies House, the Care Commission, and it should have procedures setting out who will do this, when and how. Regulators commonly require annual accounts and an update and notice of changes to basic organisational information, and usually have strict deadlines. The regulatory burden is likely to increase the larger and more complex your operation becomes. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can have serious consequences.\n\n### Service Users\nInvolving service users in the governance and management of your organisation can generate new ideas, challenge assumptions, increase accountability, and help ensure that services are as relevant as possible. Involvement can cover a range of activities, from consultation, through to working in partnership to develop projects or services, right up to service users leading projects, services or organisations. However, there are often many practicalities to be overcome in order to achieve genuine user involvement. It’s important to consider service users’ motivations for getting involved, the support needs they may have, and the barriers they could face. A register of interests policy (download sample in World format) is a useful tool to help service users understand that they may have different priorities when they are acting as a trustee, and have a legal obligation to put the interests of the charity first.\n\n### The governing document\nIt’s essential that your trustees are familiar with their governing document, It’s the ‘user manual’ for the organisation and will set clear boundaries on its activities. You should review your governing document periodically, paying special attention to the part setting out the purpose of the organisation. If this no longer reflects its circumstances and aspirations, it will be time to update it. Wider approval eg from organisational members, and in some case regulators, may be necessary. If you’re a registered charity you’ll need consent from OSCR before you change your purposes as this could affect your charitable status. Your trustees should regularly assess the risks associated with the organisation’s current and planned activities and decide whether its legal status is fit for purpose\n\n### Collective Responsibility\nAll trustees collectively have the ultimate responsibility for running a voluntary organisation, for its property, finances (download sample financial policies and procedures), staff and volunteers. They can be personally responsible for what it does, depending on the organisation’s legal structure Trustees can delegate some of their authority (eg to staff), but they can never delegate their responsibility.\n\nAs responsibility is collective, if there are any legal or financial repercussions from decisions made by the trustees, then all members of that group are legally liable in equal proportion. The behavior of one trustee is the concern of all the others. If a trustee is absent from a meeting, they are still responsible for decisions made when they were not present. Their absence does not absolve them from responsibility or liability.\n\n### Payment\nTrustees are almost always unpaid as third sector organisations are established for public benefit, and not for personal gain. A common exception is where a trustee is the best person to do a specific piece of work for the organisation, which would in any event be purchased. They may then be paid a one-off fee. Good practice dictates that trustees should not receive any routine remuneration for their time or effort, though of course all out-of-pocket expenses should be reimbursed.\n\nFor Scottish charities, payment of trustees is allowed under certain conditions, including:\n\n* the maximum level of payment is written down and agreed\n* that this level is reasonable and in the charity’s best interests\n* that the charity’s governing document allows such payment\n* that only a minority of the trustees receive such payment or are connected with trustees who do.\n\nThis would allow employees to join the board of a charity, but is not recommended as it can maximize the potential for conflicts of interest (the employee would theoretically also be their own employer) and is frowned upon by some funders.\n\n### Staff and volunteers\nThe trustees have responsibility for the overall governance and direction of the organisation, and have a duty of care for volunteers and staff. If you have paid staff it’s important to be clear about separate roles and responsibilities, and legal liabilities. There should be policies and procedures on delegated decision-making and tasks. Some tasks should never be delegated to staff, eg: the recruitment, support, supervision and appraisal of your lead employee, final decisions on key staffing issues such as disciplinary and grievance procedures. Trustees have key legal obligations including:\n\n* ensuring employees receive written terms of employment\n* consulting with employees with regard to redundancies, mergers and health and safety\n* ensuring employee liability insurance is in place.\n\nThe lines between governance and management are easily blurred, particularly for organisations without paid staff. But the broad difference is that governance is about strategy, and management is about operations. \n\n| Governance    | Management    |\n| ------------- |-------------|\n|Overview of organisation as a whole   | Day to day operation of projects |\n| Long-term direction      | Short to medium-term implementation of plans    |\n| Processes and frameworks for effective working | Detailed planning and supervision  |\n| Accountable for actions and decisions | Responsible for delivery |\n\n## Specific Roles\nWhilst each trustee has equal legal and financial responsibility, there are specific roles such as Chair, Treasurer and Secretary. These are often referred to as ‘office bearers’. Their roles can vary between different organisations, but there are some core duties:\n\n### Chair\nThe Chair or Convener has a leadership role and is usually delegated the line-management of the chief executive on its behalf. Key duties can include:\n\n* preparing agendas for the meeting in consultation with the staff and other trustees\n* ensuring meetings are run efficiently, and discussion and decision-making is democratic and fully participative\n* holding the casting vote in the event of a split decision\n* ensuring that AGMs and EGMs are carried out according to the governing document.\n\nThe Chair may also represent the organisation at external events and meetings, act as a cheque signatory, and take part in staff recruitment. Many organisations also appoint a Vice-Chair to share the workload and deputise for the Chair.\n\n### Treasurer\nIt’s important that all trustees collectively play their part in financial monitoring and decision making. The treasurer’s primary role is to assist and advise the board in overseeing the finances (download sample financial policies and procedures), even if paid staff deal with much of the day-to-day financial business. Some of the tasks can include:\n\n* controlling and accounting for the organisation’s finances\n* issuing receipts for cash received, keeping records of cash paid out, and being a counter signatory to any major banking transaction\n* overseeing bookkeeping\n* presenting financial reports, raising issues and answering questions at regular meetings and the AGM\n* liaising with the auditors or financial examiners for the annual review of accounts\n* ensuring statutory returns are made to any relevant regulators\n\n### Secretary\nThe Secretary can be responsible for many specific tasks, some of which will be regular practical administrative duties of paid staff in larger organisations. These can include:\n\n* convening meetings and booking rooms\n* dealing with correspondence and being a cheque signatory\n* preparing agendas for meetings (in consultation with the Chair)\n* taking the minutes of meetings and ensuring back-up information is available where required.\n\nUnless your governing document states it as a requirement, you no longer have to have a company secretary under company law. The position of a ‘company secretary’ has a specific legal meaning, and is responsible for ensuring that regulations are complied with. Their duties include:\n\n* preparing paperwork for meetings\n* overseeing procedures for the operation of the board (eg organising the AGM)\n* providing the Registrar of Companies with required information eg financial returns, changes in directors, and notification of where the organisation’s records are kept.\n\nThe company secretary doesn’t have to be a board or staff member, or anyone directly connected to the organisation.

SCVO has a partnership with [Keegan and Pennykid](http://www.keegan-pennykid.com/) to provide independent financial advice to voluntary organisations in Scotland. They also carry out workforce assessments to confirm which of your employees have to be automatically enrolled. \n\nThere is lots of help available from the [Pensions Regulator](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/employers/finding-a-provider.aspx).\n\nThe Pensions Regulator will contact you 12 months before your staging date, the date by which you have to have auto-enrolment in place). You can [find out your staging date on their website](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/employers/know-your-staging-date.aspx).\n\nYou should communicate with your employees so that they know ahead of time what is happening and can decide whether to join the pension scheme or not. Even though employees will be automatically enrolled, they can still choose to opt out.\n\nFrom your staging date you should make all eligible employees members of the pension scheme, unless they have opted out.\n\nYou must keep records for all employees to show that they have opted in or out.\n\nThe Charity Finance Group has useful guidance:\n\n[Auto-enrolment for charities: a how to guide](http://www.cfg.org.uk/news/press-releases/2013/november/~/media/Files/Resources/CFDG%20Publications/Auto_EnrolmentPublication.ashx)\n\n[Auto-enrolment for small charities: what you need to know](http://www.cfg.org.uk/Policy/~/media/Files/Resources/CFDG%20Publications/smlcharitiesautoenrolment.pdf)\n\n## Mediation\n[SCVO’s mediation service](/running-your-organisation/governance/mediation) can help deal with any thorny issues.",

        "en" : "# Volunteers\nVolunteers can play an exceptionally important role in your organisation. Make sure their volunteering is well managed and effective for everyone involved.\n\n## Volunteer policy\nAs well as being responsible for paid staff, your management committee will be responsible for deploying your volunteers effectively. So it is essential that your written policies include volunteers. \n\nA volunteer policy is a written statement of the aims and values of an organisation, and the role that volunteers have in it. Volunteers should know what they can expect from their volunteering, and what you expect from them.\n\nMany voluntary organisations tend to assume that their volunteers have no legal rights, but this is a dangerous assumption to make. Depending on the degree of formality in the way in which volunteering is organised, volunteers can qualify for legal protection under employment law. Increasingly, volunteers are recruited under volunteering agreements that cover grievance and disciplinary procedures and equal opportunities. While it is good practice to respect the contribution of volunteers in a formal way, you should be aware that the greater the degree of formality in the arrangement, the greater the chance of legal relations being created.\n\nIt is important to outline clearly in writing:\n\n* the time commitment needed from the volunteer. This should include the actual volunteering tasks and time for attending supervision and training\n* a role description that gives a realistic picture of the tasks they will be expected to do\n* the personal qualities and behaviour required\n* your policy on expenses\n* their investment in the organisation, scope for representation etc.\n\n## Recruitment\nWhen recruiting volunteers, it is important to have an interview process and to take up references. This is because volunteers may be in positions of responsibility, working with vulnerable people and dealing with the organisation’s assets. Where volunteers have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults they may also need to be [disclosure checked](http://www.crbs.org.uk/).\n\nA good formal volunteer recruitment process can help impress upon a volunteer the importance of their role, and help them decide themselves whether they are suitable for the post.\n\nSome organisations experience difficulties in recruiting enough volunteers. But this should not lead to a lowering of standards, particularly when placing volunteers with vulnerable clients. For assistance with recruitment of volunteers contact your local Volunteer Centre who can advertise your opportunities online and work with you to recruit from the people who contact them. \n\n[Find your local Volunteer Centre](http://www.volunteerscotland.org.uk/)\n\n[Volunteer Development Scotland](http://www.vds.org.uk/) has a wealth of information about all aspects of volunteering.\n\n## Training & support\nOnce recruited, it is vital to ensure that all volunteers are properly trained, supported and insured. Remember that it is a two way contract and volunteers want something in return for their efforts. Providing support is not always straightforward. Sometimes volunteers will be working alone and dispersed. The times that they are available may not automatically coincide with the hours staff work. Arranging support and supervision requires forethought and flexibility. Peer support can be important and useful to volunteers. Many people volunteer as a form of socialising. This can be helped by organising events that bring volunteers together.\nPayment of volunteers\n\nVolunteering is an opportunity for people to give their time, energy and skills. No volunteers should be out-of-pocket as a result of their volunteering. Where someone incurs expenses as a direct result of their volunteering activities they should be reimbursed. This ensures that individuals are not excluded from volunteering on the basis of income. Out of pocket expenses for volunteers may include:\n\n* travelling expenses\n* other subsistence costs – food and drink\n* any special clothing or tools\n* training\n* childcare.\n\nOrganisations should ensure that they do not pay volunteers expenses at a flat rate, regardless of the actual expenses incurred, as this greatly increases the chance that the relationship will fall within the scope of employment and discrimination law. Payment of out-of-pocket expenses to a reasonable level is legitimate and should not give rise to any tax liability, problems with benefits, or charity law.\n\nOrganisations should:\n\n* produce detailed guidance on expenses\n* provide all volunteers with information about claiming out-of-pocket expenses\n* establish a system for reimbursing expenses which reflects the organisation’s commitment to paying expenses as part of equal opportunities and enables volunteers to claim expenses without embarrassment\n* budget for volunteers’ expenses.\n\n## For more information see:\n[Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC)](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/)\n\n[GOV.UK guide to volunteer placements, rights and expenses](https://www.gov.uk/volunteering) \n\n[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR)](http://www.oscr.org.uk/) ",

These shares are then pooled and loaned out to other investors or invested in other financial institutions.\n\nAfter administration costs are deducted and reserves are established, any surplus is distributed back to the members as a dividend. By restricting membership, the original Credit Union principle of mutual self-help is preserved.\n\n## Is there a membership fee?\nA one-time membership fee of £5 is payable by all new Credit Union members – this amount will be deducted from your first payment.\n\n## Can I make cash payments?\nBecause we are a national credit union, it is not possible to deal with cash transactions. Therefore we offer two alternatives for payment:\n\n* by completing the direct debit form, we will automatically withdraw the agreed amount from your bank account on the first of each month\n* we also offer monthly payments by payroll deduction. To make this service viable, we require a minimum of five members in an organisation who have prior approval from their payroll department. Once this is obtained, the Credit Union will liaise directly to enable this service to proceed.\n\nAny loans granted are paid directly into the bank account nominated in your application form or subsequently amended in writing.\n\n## What can I borrow money for?\nFor any purpose you require funds for. For example, household goods, holidays, Christmas expenses, car repairs, bill payments, redecoration, special occasions or emergency assistance.\n\n## How much can I borrow and what’s the repayment period?\nYou can borrow up to three times your savings balance, up to a maximum of £5,000, and over a three year repayment period. All loans are granted at the discretion of the credit committee.\n\n## How soon can I take a loan?\nYou have to be a member of the SCVO Credit Union for three months before you can apply for a loan. We also have a policy against the use of share loading, which is the deposit of a lump sum to increase the savings balance simply in order to increase the amount that can be borrowed.\n\n## What are the repayment costs?\nYou can see what your loan costs would be with our handy loan calculator.\n\nUnder the law, credit unions are restricted to a loan rate of 1% per month on the reducing balance. That works out to a very modest 12.68% APR.\n\nIt is the SCVO Credit Union policy to strongly encourage a savings habit even during a loan repayment period.\n\n## Who manages the SCVO Credit Union?\nManagement of the SCVO Credit Union is by a volunteer board of directors who are elected at the annual meeting by fellow members. The credit committee, who deal with loan applications, and the supervisory committee who audit the operation, are also elected by members, under the one member, one vote system\n\n## Do I get a dividend on my savings?\nWhen the Credit Union achieves the level of income from loans for all expenses to be paid, any surplus is divided between reserves and a dividend payment. The amount is decided at the AGM in line with our not-for-profit philosophy.\n\n## Are my savings protected?\nIt is a requirement of the Credit Union Act 1979 that all credit unions have a bonding insurance to protect members’ savings from fraud and dishonesty. Savings protection is also provided by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the individual limit of £85.000.",

        "en" : "# Introduction from the Credit Union convener\nAs a new member, I would like to welcome you to the SCVO Credit Union. Membership of the SCVO Credit Union means you are an owner of the only financial institution that uniquely serves the voluntary sector throughout Scotland.\n\nAs you already know, by joining together in a credit union we can all benefit from pooling our resources – individual, accessible and regular savings help provide low cost loans to our members. Mutual investments mean mutual benefits.\n\nBut you see, this is only the start. Through time, and with your assistance, we plan to develop our credit union and the services we offer. This means that more benefits will be yours to enjoy.\n\nRemember we all own the credit union. If you have any ideas on how it can be improved or don’t like something that is happening, have your say. All members are notified of annual general meetings and are most welcome to attend. And of course, we always have room for new volunteers on the management board, so contact us if you would like to get involved.\n\nIn the meantime, make full use of your Credit Union – that’s what it’s there for. And remember to spread the word among colleagues and family members.\n\n## Introduction\nPut very simply, the SCVO Credit Union is an association through which its members are encouraged to save on a regular basis. These savings are pooled and invested, in other financial institution and in loans to members of the Credit Union. After administration costs are deducted and prudent reserves established any surplus can be distributed to members as a dividend. For this reason, savings are sometimes described as shares, each having a value of £1.\n\nThe SCVO Credit Union is run by its members for the benefit of its members, but this does not mean the policies and procedures are any less professional than those applied by any other financial institution. Everyone directly involved in the management of the Credit Union must be properly trained. We must also satisfy the Financial Services Authority (FSA) that our policies and procedures of the highest standard, before registration is awarded.\n\nSCVO Credit Union is authorised and registered by the Financial Services Authority and is therefore subject to its rules and regulations. This includes close administration and financial controls, the service of the Financial Service Ombudsman Scheme for ultimate complaints adjudication, and inclusion in the Financial Service Compensation Scheme which provides a guarantee for your savings with us.\n\n### Data protection and sharing information\nThe Credit Union will process your data in accordance with your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. We will use your information for the following purposes:\n\n* to consider any application that you make\n* to deal with your account and the provision of services\n* to undertake statistical analysis, financial risk assessment, money laundering check, compliance and regulatory recording, fraud prevention and debt tracing.\n\nUnder the Category F Consumer Credit Licence, we only disclose information outside the credit union to:\n\n* agents and subcontractors for operational reasons\n* any person, including insurers, who provide a service or benefit to you or for us in connection with your accounts\n* licensed credit reference agencies in accordance with the Data Protection Act and the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1979\n* fraud prevention and other agencies to help prevent crime where we suspect fraud.\n\nAnd, if compelled to do so by law, we will disclose information for the purpose of compliance and regulatory reporting to confirm your identity for money laundering purposes which may include the electoral register.\n\nWith all this in mind, the SCVO Credit Union will safeguard its members’ interests through proper adherence to agreed procedures and internal controls, and take the utmost care not to risk its members’ savings, or expose individual members to onerous loan arrangements.  This guide seeks to explain how the SCVO Credit Union operates and answer any questions you may have.\n\n## How does the Credit Union work?\nWe have tried to make the day-to-day operations and policies of the SCVO Credit Union easy to understand and, from the members’ viewpoint, easy to access. We offer payments methods:\n\n* on completion of a direct debit form. We will automatically withdraw the agreed amount from your bank account on the first of each month\n* on completion of a payroll deduction/amendment form. It may be possible to deduct the agreed payment directly from your salary. There is a requirement for prior agreement with your payroll office and a minimum number of members from your organisation for the viability of this service. Please contact the Credit Union office for further information.\n\n## Savings\nSavings are made on a monthly basis, collected from you and credited to your Credit Union account. There are no upper or lower limits on the amount you can save each month, but when setting your savings level please do remember that you are not saving to a current account from which regular withdrawals are expected.\n\nYou should be comfortable with the amount you save and it shouldn’t detract from your ability to meet your anticipated monthly outgoings.\n\nIn addition to regular monthly savings, you may make further occasional deposits provided that the accumulated total of your savings does not exceed £10,000. This maximum is established by legislation and cannot be exceeded.\n\nThere is no lower limit to your regular deposits, but because the value of your accumulated savings will help determine how much you can borrow, you are encouraged to save at least £10 per month, if possible.\n\nWhile it is our policy not to receive any payments by cash, additional payments may be sent by cheque clearly stating which account is to be credited, or by an internet banking method. When making a banking transaction by internet, please ensure you include the middle four digits of your account as part of the reference (10**9999**01). If in doubt, please phone for further information\n\nIn the event of a loan being taken out, we reserve the right to take a lien (held as security) over the shares in the account until such time as the loan is repaid.\nInterest (if paid), is based on each member’s average share holdings once a year, shortly after the AGM. The rate paid is provisionally determined by the board in line with FSA guidance policy and presented at the AGM for ratification by the membership. It is paid gross and should be declared to the income tax authorities.\n\n## Savings withdrawal\n[You may withdraw all or part of your savings at any time on giving written or email notice to the Credit Union](http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Share-Withdrawal-Form.pdf). If you have a loan outstanding at the time you wish to withdraw your shares, the law states you may only withdraw an amount that will not reduce your share balance to less than the amount of the outstanding loan. Repayment of your savings will be by electronic transfer to your nominated bank account.\n\n## Loans\nOnce a saving pattern has been established and in place for at least three months, you may apply for a loan of up to a maximum of three times the value of your accrued savings at the date of the loan application. Generally, no loan may exceed an upper limit of £5,000. No loans of £5,000 or more will be given in the first year of membership.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, we would consider loans up to £10,000. In this circumstance, we would require you to fulfil additional criteria and provide additional documentation.\n\nLoans fall into two categories: secured and unsecured. A loan is deemed secured when the amount borrowed is less than or equal to, the value of the borrower’s savings. A loan is unsecured if the amount borrowed exceed the value of the borrower’s savings.\n\nBecause an unsecured loan may expose the Credit Union to a higher degree of risk, and bearing in mind the Credit Union’s duty to protect its members’ savings, an application for an unsecured loan will be referred to the credit committee for approval. For this reason, loan applications should be submitted at least two weeks before the loan is required.\n\nThe maximum repayment term for a loan is 36 months. Loans over £5,000 may be extended to be repaid over 60 months.\n\n## Share loading\nThe SCVO Credit Union has a policy against share loading, which is the deposit of a lump sum to increase the share balance to increase the amount that can be borrowed.\nLoan payouts\n\nThe SCVO Credit Union policy is to not make any payments in cash or by cheque. Your loan will therefore be credited electronically by BACS to your nominated bank or building society account.\n\n## Loan calculator\n[A loan calculator for approximate monthly costs is available here](http://www.scvo.org.uk/running-your-organisation/credit-union/credit-union-loan-repayment-calculator/).\n\n## Loan repayments\nThe capital sum and the loan period determine the monthly payments required to repay your loan. Additional, partial or full repayments are permissible at any time without penalty.\n\nLoan repayment illustration tables using an APR of 12.68%\n\n**12 month repayment period**\n\n| Loan amount (£) | Monthly repayment (£.p) | Total loan interest (£.p) | Total loan repayment (£.p) |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 100 | 8.88 | 6.63 | 106.63 |\n| 500 | 44.42 | 33.11 | 533.11 |\n| 1000 | 88.85 | 66.19 | 1066.19 |\n| 5000 | 444.24 | 330.93 | 5330.93 |\n\n**24 month repayment period**\n\n| Loan amount (£) | Monthly repayment (£.p) | Total loan interest (£.p) | Total loan repayment (£.p) |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 100 | 4.71 | 12.97 | 112.97 |\n| 500 | 23.54 | 64.86 | 564.86 |\n| 1000 | 47.07 | 129.79 | 1129.79 |\n| 5000 | 235.57 | 648.80 | 5648.80 |\n\n**36 month repayment period**\n\n| Loan amount (£) | Monthly repayment (£.p) | Total loan interest (£.p) | Total loan repayment (£.p) |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 100 | 3.32 | 19.55 | 119.55 |\n| 500 | 16.61 | 97.84 | 597.84 |\n| 1000 | 33.21 | 196.78 | 1195.78 |\n| 5000 | 166.07 | 978.59 | 5978.59 |\n\nIn practice the monthly repayment above is rounded up to the nearest £1. Other loan repayments can be calculated by multiplying the above figures as required.\n\n**Example**\n\nA member with a share savings of £200 might borrow £600 repayable at £28.24 a month over 2 years. At the end of the repayment period the total interest charged would be £77.76    (24 x £28.24 = £677.76, less original £600 borrowed). If they had rounded up their monthly payment by an additional £6.76 to £35 per month, their savings balance would have increased to £362 24, that is (£6.76 x 24 = £162.24 + £200 original savings). Based on this increased share balance, the member can then borrow up to £1086 (3 x £362).\n\n## Payments by direct debit\nIf your existing monthly savings exceed the required loan instalments you need not increase your monthly payment. If not, your payments must be increased to a level at least sufficient to repay the loan over the agreed period. By fully completing the loan application, any amendments to your direct debit are made automatically between the Credit Union and your bank.\n\n## Payments by payroll deduction\nf your existing monthly savings exceed the required loan instalments you need not increase your monthly payment. If not, your payments must be increased to a level at least sufficient to repay the loan over the agreed period. This is done by the completion of an additional green payroll deduction authority amendment form as well as completing a loan application.\n\n## Saving through the loan repayment period\nIn order to provide our members with choice, it is the policy of this Credit Union to quote monthly loan repayment figures at the lowest amount possible, thereby making you aware of the benefit of low cost loans. However, in keeping with the philosophy of the Credit Union movement, we would strongly encourage you to continue the savings habit by recommending that you continue to pay an additional amount into your share account during this period. It will of course also allow you to borrow more next time if you so wish.  An illustration is given in appendix one.\n\n## Loan interest\nInterest is charged at 1% per month on the reducing balance of the loan, which is an APR of 12.68% – a rate that compares well with commercially available options, especially for smaller loans repayable over short periods.\n\n## Top-up loans\nIn normal circumstances, a member can have only one loan from the Credit Union at any one time.\nA loan may be refinanced up to two times after the initial loan, within normal lending criteria, before full repayment is required.\nA minimum number of repayments – normally 25% of the value and term of loan being refinanced and at least six months – must be repaid before refinancing is considered.\nA loan outwith normal lending criteria might be considered to assist in meeting an emergency situation.\n\n## Changing circumstances\nShould you experience any financial difficulty in repaying your loan, you should contact the Credit Union office at the earliest opportunity and explain the circumstances.\nRemember that all information received from or about you is held in total confidence and will not be divulged. You must provide details in writing of your changed circumstances for us to help resolve your problem. Please remember, we can only help you if you talk to us.\n\n## Loan cancellation rights\nYou have the statutory right to cancel a loan credit agreement within 14 days, on payment of the outstanding loan plus any interest accrued. Please contact the Credit Union office immediately if you wish to exercise this right.\n\n## Loan insurance\nOther than for pre-existing condition limitations, all loans, after a health-qualifying period of six months, are insured for the death of the borrower. In this unfortunate event, any loan outstanding, up to the prescribed maximum in force at the time, will be claimed against the Credit Union’s insurance policy. Full details are available from the Credit Union on request. This service is provided free of charge to our members. The maximum insurance claim allowable as of January 2009 is £5,000 and is subject to change.\nManaging your account\n\n## Annual account statements\nOnce a year, a statement showing all financial transactions on your account for the previous year, up to the close of business on 30 September, will be issued. Interim balance details can be obtained on application to the Credit Union office at any time.\n\n## Retiring or leaving the voluntary sector\nIn the event that your association with an SCVO member organisation is broken, you may continue in membership of the SCVO Credit Union but must advise the management committee of the changed circumstances as soon as possible. Your co-operation in this respect will be appreciated because the Credit Union is required to monitor its membership to ensure the common bond is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\n## Inoperative accounts\nAny account held with £25 or less in shares and does not have any transactions between 1 October and 30 September the following year will be subject to a £5 annual charge until the account is either closed, or transactions restarted. This charge is non-refundable.\n\n## Ceasing membership\nYou may end your membership at any time simply by notifying the Credit Union on the appropriate form that you no longer wish to be a member. Your accrued savings balance at the date of resignation will be transferred to your nominated bank account.\n\nThe balance of any outstanding loan in your name will be set against your accrued savings, or must otherwise be paid in full, before your resignation can be accepted. It may also be possible to reduce your balance to a minimum of £5 and put your monthly savings payment on hold. This would allow you to maintain your account with us until such time as your circumstances improve and you restart your savings plan. Please contact the Credit Union if you want to consider this option.\n\n## Cancellation rights\nA member has the right to cancel their membership with the Credit Union without penalty within 14 days of the day of the conclusion of the contract, or from when they receive the contractual terms and conditions.\n\n## Governance\nThe Credit Union is governed by and for its membership. Three committees are elected at the annual general meeting to oversee the management of the Credit Union. Members of these committees act in an entirely voluntary capacity and receive no remuneration. Committee members have a statutory duty to abide by the rules of the Credit Union and act in the interest of the Credit Union and its members at all times. The committees elect their office bearers from within their own membership.\n\n## The management committee\nThe management committee is the main committee of the Credit Union with a remit to establish policies and procedures, to oversee financial and administrative operations and to report to members and the registrar, and to ensure the Credit Union accounts are audited annually.\n\n## The credit committee\nThis committee works within the policies and procedures established by the management committee to consider all loan applications and authorise those which are approved for payment.\n\n## The supervisory committee\nThis is the compliance watchdog of the Credit Union, established to ensure all policies and procedures are developed within the framework of the law and rules governing the Credit Union movement, and are adhered to at all times by the management and credit committees.\n\n## Complaints procedure\nA complaints procedure is in place to ensure an equitable resolution of any difference you may have with the Credit Union. Should you wish to make a complaint you should write in the first instance to the Credit Union secretary, giving full details and marking the envelope private and confidential.\n\n## Financial Services Compensation Scheme\nWe are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) which can pay compensation to depositors if a Credit Union is unable to meet its financial obligations. In respect of deposits, an eligible depositor is entitled to claim up to £85,000. For joint accounts this may be £85,000 each, making a total of £170,000.\n\n## Treating customers fairly\nFairness underpins our ethos towards new and existing members and as member owners of the Credit Union we encourage your active participation. Your interest, views and opinions matters to us, as they help shape and introduce changes which will deliver real benefits for all members.\nWe continuously demonstrate this policy through our risk assessment procedures, the exposure of loan defaulters, and we also implement polices to reflect the changes in anti-money laundering practices and procedures.\n\nIf you have any queries or views, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly with any aspect of our service, please do not hesitate to contact us with your comments. We can be contacted directly on 0131 474 8003.\n\n## How you can help the Credit Union\nYou can help us simply by being an active member, saving and borrowing sensibly and regularly, and acting as an advocate for the Credit Union by encouraging others to see the advantages and join. Success for your Credit Union and the development and introduction of new features and services will come as the SCVO Credit Union expands in size and penetration throughout the voluntary sector in Scotland. Your help in that process will be invaluable.\n\nIn time, you will also be encouraged to stand for election to one or more of the governing committees. All successful organisations depend on a full participation by their membership and the SCVO Credit Union is no different – we will have to ensure rotation of our committee membership and replace those who have retired or resigned.\n\nWilling volunteers are always welcome and the tasks are interesting and educational. Please give serious consideration to standing for office and contributing to a vibrant future for the SCVO Credit Union.\n\n## Passing on other customers\nThe SCVO Credit Union savings and borrowing benefits can be enjoyed by your work colleagues and family members. (Family members need to be over 18 years old and living at your home address).\n\nPlease do not hesitate to pass our contact details to your work colleagues and family members, and we will then send out membership application forms directly to them. You can contact us directly on 0131 474 8003.",

        "en" : "# Keystone\nKeyStone is a quality award and management toolkit for the people who manage village halls and community buildings. It provides checklists and resources to help you manage your building.\n\nKeyStone is an entirely voluntary quality award and management system that will help strengthen your organisation. Unlike other quality awards it’s been designed specifically for organisations running community facilities like village halls, community centres, youth and heritage centres. It provides comprehensive supporting resources and a mentor to help and encourage you.\n\nCompleting the Keystone Award will help you to:\n\n* ensure you meet all necessary legal and regulatory requirements for running your building\n* organise your files, documents and information to make life easier for you and future committees\n* provide evidence to others that you run a well managed facility\n* secure a long term future for your facility\n* understand  where to go for help\n* have confidence that you’re doing things right\n\nGaining a KeyStone Award can create positive publicity around your organisation which may make it easier to recruit new volunteers. Funders will see that it is a well-managed organisation increasing the chances of successful support. KeyStone can also help you make the case for a community asset transfer of a building.  Other benefits include discounts on Keegan and Pennykid insurance and the Hallmaster booking system.\n\n## How does it work?\nThe KeyStone toolkit is a step by step guide to making sure your organisation is efficient, legal and effective.\n\nKeyStone focuses on keeping your organisation legal and looking after your volunteers, staff and users. It sets minimum requirements for your organisation and will help you meet your legal obligations and organisational objectives.\n\nThe toolkit is split into six sections with information, guidance, resources and actions for each of the themes.\n\n* Governance – making sure your organisation is effectively and properly run\n* Managing people – supporting and valuing volunteers, staff and users and making sure that you meet your legal obligations to them\n* Managing money – managing and controlling your money effectively and complying with regulations on accounting\n* Managing resources – ensuring that you comply with building maintenance legislation and regulation, keeping appropriate records and safeguarding the facility for future generations\n* Working with users – putting the needs of users at the heart of your management and focusing on providing good facilities, services and activities\n* Legislation and regulation – understanding and complying with relevant legislation and regulation and helping to make sure your organisation is on the right side of the law\n\nBy working your way methodically through these sections and their associated checklists, you will build up a resource unique to your organisation, which contains:\n\n* Quick reference guide to all your policies and procedures\n* Legal documentation for your organisation and building\n* Evidence of compliance with regulation and legislation\n* Action points to help you improve in the future\n\nIt’s important to maintain the standard you have reached and you will need to renew each level of your award every three years.\nMentoring support\n\nThe KeyStone toolkit provides a range of information and resources to help you, but sometimes you need more tailored information and support. In most cases we can match you with a KeyStone mentor who will be appointed from a local voluntary sector support organisation. They will answer any questions, help you get started and provide assistance as you progress.\n\n## Assessment\nAssessment is a supportive process that involves a visit from a KeyStone assessor who will check that you have completed the checklist and have the supporting evidence in place. It’s a great opportunity to discuss how you run your building and get some feedback from an expert.\n\n## How long will it take?\nThe time it takes to complete KeyStone will be dependent on your starting point, the time you have available and how many actions you need to follow up. We hope that most organisations will be able to progress to an assessment visit within one year of signing up. Your mentor will keep in contact with you and arrange an assessment visit when they think you’re ready. Don’t forget to ask for support if you need it.\n\n## Recognising your achievement\nOn passing your KeyStone assessment you will be presented with a certificate that you can frame and proudly display in your building. You’ll probably want to have a celebration and let others know about your achievements. You’ll be able to use the KeyStone logo on letterheads and publicity material.\n\n## Register\nKeyStone is free but we need you to register to take part and your committee should agree to undertake the award.\n\nPlease contact our [Engagement Officer, Sandra Hogg](mailto:Sandra.hogg@scvo.org.uk), for further information or to discuss the award.",

If it wants to own property etc, it must rely on individuals to do so on its behalf. This increases the risk of personal liability for those involved in running the organisation.\n\nAn incorporated organisation has a legal identity of its own. This means that it can own property, enter into contracts and employ people in its own name. Incorporation means the liability of the organisation to third parties is limited to the total amount of the members’ guarantees. This gives protection to those running the organisation and its members in most cases. However, it also means that committee members need to take their responsibilities very seriously as they are legally binding. There are also obligatory reporting duties, for example for companies to their official regulatory body – Companies House, for Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation – OSCR.\n\nHowever, personal liability may still occur if trustees are:\n\n* reckless\n* negligent\n* act illegally\n* act outwith their powers in the management and control of the organisation\n\nIt’s important to get your legal structure right both for now and the future, because the wrong structure can get in the way of doing your work effectively, and may increase the risk of personal liability.",

Various social clubs and sports clubs, most community-led charities, community development trusts, housing associations and credit unions also fall within this category.\n\n## Different roles\nMembers can attend the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and have the power to take certain fundamental decisions, such as making changes to the constitution and dissolving the organisation. They also elect board members. The board hold regular meetings between AGMs and control and supervise the activities of the organisation. They monitor the financial position of the organisation.\n\nDon’t be put off setting up a membership organisation just because the steering group can’t identify people who would be interested in forming the wider membership.

If they can, what voting rights will they have? How will you address any potential conflicts of interest?\n* should bodies, as distinct from individuals, be entitled to membership?\n* should the board have power to veto any application for membership?\n* should someone who no longer fulfils the qualifications automatically cease to be a member?\n* would you allow young people under 16 to become members?\n\nCheck out our [frequently asked questions](/setting-up-a-charity/faq) for help with some of these issues.\n\n## Legal structures for a membership organisation\nThe possible [legal structures](/setting-up-a-charity/decide-on-structure) for a membership organisation would be:\n\n* a voluntary association\n* a company limited by guarantee\n* an industrial and provident society\n* Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO)\n\nWith certain legal structures, members have more responsibilities than others (eg SCIO).

        "en" : "# Company Limited by Guarantee\nA company is a membership organisation formed and registered under the provisions of the Companies Acts. It is incorporated and benefits from limited liability for its members.\n\nIt’s a structure that can be chosen by voluntary organisations that employ staff, regularly enter into contracts, manage investments, and/or own property and other assets, because limited liability helps to minimise the threat of personal liability for the directors.\n\nIt is regulated by Companies House and subject to the Companies Acts and other legislation. If a company is charitable then it will be subject to charity law and regulated by OSCR as well.\n\nIf you are considering this structure and are planning to apply for charitable status, why not consider setting up as a [Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation](scio.md)? This is a corporate body which provides limited liability for its members and is suitable for organisations that want to become charities, but do not want or need the complex structure of company law.\n\n### Advantages\n* It’s a private limited company that has guarantors rather than shareholders, so it’s suitable for voluntary organisations. The members agree to pay a fixed amount known as a guarantee (usually £1) towards the company’s debts if it goes into liquidation. \n* The company is a clear legal entity, separate from the persons involved in it – and can hold property, enter into leases and other contracts, employ people, etc, in its own name. It doesn’t matter if the directors change because it is the company and not the directors that hold title to land, enter into contracts, etc, but changes must be notified to Companies House. \n* A company is generally regarded by funding bodies and public agencies as a more ‘stable’ structure than a voluntary association. \n\n### Disadvantages\n* There are formal registration procedures to be followed in relation to creating a company, in addition to the process of applying to be recognised as a charity, unlike with a SCIO which needs only to be registered with OSCR.\n* There is an ongoing requirement to notify a change in directors, a change in the company secretary, or a change in the registered office to Companies House. Similarly, annual accounts and annual returns have to be filed. If a charitable, a company must also file an annual return with OSCR, and notify or seek prior consent from OSCR before making certain changes.\n* There are various statutory requirements which have to be followed in relation to members’ meetings etc. \n* A company structure may be more intimidating for those considering whether to join as members or put themselves forward for election to the board of directors. \n* Set up costs can be higher than for a voluntary association or trust; and annual costs are higher, particularly if there is an external company secretary and/or if a formal audit is required.\n\n## How is it governed?\nA company is created with documents known as a memorandum of association and articles of association. If a charity, these must be approved by OSCR.\n\nIts governing body is made up of the directors who have a legal responsibility for the company and ensure it carries out its activities properly.\n\n## Charitable status?\nYou may choose to set up a company and register as a Scottish charity if the company meets the criteria for being a charity. Equally, you can set up a company without seeking charitable status.\n\n## Does it have a legal status, distinct from those who run it?\nYes. However, so far as limited liability is concerned, it should be recognised that, although the company format does provide a very substantial level of protection against personal liability, the limit on liability does not extend to any liability which a person might incur in their capacity as director of the company, as distinct from their capacity as a member. There are a range of legal duties imposed on directors of a limited company which could give rise to personal liability. Broadly speaking, however, it is extremely unlikely that a director would find themselves personally liable as a matter of practice, unless they acted in a manner which was negligent or improper. It is important, though, that those involved should have a reasonable understanding of what is involved in relation to their duties as directors.\n\n## Write your constitution\nA company limited by guarantee is a clear legal entity separate from the people involved in it. It must comply with UK company law and is accountable to Companies House. The company has no shareholders and does not distribute profit. Its members’ liabilities are limited to a guaranteed sum – usually £1. If it is a charitable company, then it will also be accountable to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, and must comply with charity law. It is possible to create a not-for-profit company which is not a charity, in which case it is accountable only to Companies House. If your organisation is not proposing to pursue charitable status, but will clearly be operating for the benefit of the community, the CIC model may be worthy of consideration. The key features of a CIC are set out in the section Decide on a Legal Structure. Many organisations are now investigating becoming a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) rather than a charitable company limited by guarantee. This offers all of the same advantages of being a company limited by guarantee with the added benefit of only reporting to one regulator (OSCR).\n\n## Choosing the Name\nThere are a number of things you need to think about when choosing the name of your organisation. There are some particular issues when choosing a suitable name for a voluntary sector company. If the company is expected to be registered as a charity, it would be possible to omit the word “Limited” from the company name. That would not affect the principle of limited liability, and the only implication is that the company would have to state clearly on its communications that it was a limited company. There are certain words laid down in statutory instruments which can be used in a company name only if their use can be justified in reference to certain criteria, or if special clearance has been obtained. The “sensitive” words which are likely to be of most relevance in the context of a new voluntary-sector company are as follows:\n\n* Association\n* Charitable\n* Federation\n* Foundation\n* Fund\n* Group\n* Holdings\n* Institute\n* International\n* Scotland\n* Scottish\n* Society\n* Trust\n\nThe level of justification (and, in some cases, support from public bodies) – and the effect on the timescale for incorporating the company – varies very much depending on the particular word involved. For example, inclusion of the word “Scotland” in brackets in a company name requires only a statement in a covering letter to Companies House that the organisation will have its administrative offices in Scotland, whereas inclusion of the word “Scottish” requires supporting letters from government agencies, etc to establish pre-eminence and may involve a significant delay before clearance is given. If the proposed company name will include any of the words listed above, you should speak to the Names Section at [Companies House](http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/) for guidance.\n\n## Model set of memorandum and articles\nYou can [download a model set of memorandum and articles (the “constitution” of a limited company)]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCVO-model-articles-of-association2016.docx and use it as the basis for your organisation. Remember that they need to be carefully drafted to reflect the aims which the organisation will be pursuing in practice, and its activities. This model memorandum and articles reflects the features that are most commonly found in the charity/voluntary sector. Be careful when making changes as there is a risk that Companies House will reject any wording which does not comply with company law. In the same way, if you are applying to OSCR for charitable status, the extent to which you can depart from the model in certain areas is limited. Those areas are identified in the detailed clause-by-clause guidance set out below.\n\n## Clause by clause guidance\nFollow [our detailed clause-by-clause guidance]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCVO-CoLtdGuarantee-guidance.pdf to find explanations of what the clause is there for, whether it is required by law, and information about decisions to be made between alternative possibilities.\n\n## Additional clauses\nThese are additional clauses you may or may not want to use, again modelled on common features within the sector. They cover such things as:\n\n* Membership by incorporated or unincorporated bodies\n* Co-opted directors\n* Some, but not all, elected directors to retire each year\n* Maximum period in office for directors\n* Outside body having right to representation on board\n* Annual membership subscription\n* Members’ power to require an extraordinary general meeting to be held\n* Alternate directors\n\n## Forming the company\n### Consultation\nYou should circulate the first draft of your articles among your steering group so everyone has the opportunity to comment, and ensure any relevant outside organisations, the wider community and key partner bodies are brought into the process of finalising the articles.\n\n### Information for Companies House\nOnce the draft is finalised the steering group should gather together the various items of information which will be needed for the incorporation documents. Where the company is applying for charitable status, this could happen while the draft is being considered by OSCR. You will need: Information about the first directors:\n\n* Full name (including all middle names)\n* Any former name (ignoring for this purpose a maiden surname)\n* Service address (this does not need to be the person’s usual residential address. If the service address is the registered business address you must indicate this)\n* Home address (this will not appear on the public record)\n* Date of birth\n* Nationality\n* Business occupation\n\n### Information about the proposed company secretary\n* Full name (including all middle names)\n* Any former name (ignoring for this purpose a maiden surname)\n* Service address (this does not need to be the person’s usual residential address. If the service address is the registered business address you must indicate this)\n\n### Information about the registered office\n* Proposed address of the registered office (including post code)\n\n### Information about the subscribers (first members)\n* Full name (including all middle names, if the subscriber is an individual)\n* Address\n\n## Applying to Companies House\nYou will need to prepare a form IN01, a signed copy of the memorandum of association and a copy of the final version of the articles of association, incorporating the information referred to above. If the company name is not to include the word “Limited”, this should be indicated in Section A3 of the form IN01. Every box on the form has to be completed. The forms and further guidance can be obtained from Companies House. Where the company is applying for charitable status you will need to wait until OSCR has issued a letter giving its informal assurance that the company will be registered as a charity. It simplifies the mechanics of obtaining signatures if the number of people signing the incorporation documents is kept fairly low. Additional members and directors can be admitted just after the company is formed. It is important that sufficient people sign the incorporation documents as first directors to form a quorum for the first meeting of the board. The full package of incorporation documents should sent to Companies House with the fee to meet the incorporation dues.\n\n## What happens then\nThe certificate of incorporation, which brings the company into existence, is normally issued around a week after receipt by Companies House. It is important to note that contracts should not be entered into until you receive the certificate of incorporation. If you urgently require a legal entity, eg to open a bank account or apply for grant funding before a specific deadline, Companies House offer a “same day” incorporation service for an increased fee. If your company is pursuing registration as a charity, you should submit a certified copy of the memorandum and articles (as submitted to Companies House), together with a copy of the certificate of incorporation to OSCR, to enable the charity registration process to be completed.\n\n## Keep a copy\nA final copy of the memorandum and articles should be carefully preserved. Each of the directors should be given a copy for future reference, and a copy should also be sent to any accountant engaged by the company.",

They define a co-operative as:\n\nA group of people acting together to meet the common needs and aspirations of its members, sharing ownership and making decisions democratically.\n\nIf a co-operative’s membership is closed or restricted, and profits are divided amongst the members, then it cannot be a charity.\n\nFurther information is available from [Co-operatives UK](http://www.uk.coop/)  or Tel: 0161 246 2900\n\n## Industrial and Provident Society (IPS)\nThe industrial and provident society represents a halfway house between a registered company and an unincorporated association. It has rules of association in much the same way as an unincorporated association, yet it is an incorporated body with the benefit of limited liability. To qualify for registration as an IPS a body must either be a co-operative society for the mutual benefit of members, or for the benefit of the community. Only those set up for the benefit of the community, and not members, will be eligible for charitable status.\n\nThe IPS offers the benefit of limited liability, but the incorporation procedure can be expensive and time-consuming, and few professional advisers will be familiar with the regime for such societies.\n\nIndustrial and provident societies are registered with the [Financial Services Authority](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/) and are regulated by the FSA under a regime which is similar to that for registered companies.\n\n## Friendly Society\nOriginally, the friendly society was an unincorporated association formed for the mutual relief and maintenance of its members, primarily in sickness and old age. While many of the functions of friendly societies have been taken over by the State, a number of large insurance organisations still retain their mutual status and are registered as friendly societies.\n\nA friendly society was unincorporated but, like Industrial and Provident Societies, became subject to a regulatory regime similar to that governing registered companies. There was no limited liability for members.\n\nWhile many charitable organisations still exist as friendly societies, it has not been possible to create a new friendly society of the original type since February 1993. All friendly societies are now regulated by the [Financial Services Authority](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/).",

        "en" : "# Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation\nA Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation is a legal structure which has been purpose built for the charity sector in Scotland. It provides limited liability and a separate legal identity to organisations that want to become charities but do not want or need the complex structure of company law. This means that even the smallest charity can access the benefits of incorporation – including limited liability and legal capacity.\n\nIt is only available to charities with a principal office in Scotland and is regulated by OSCR and subject to the Charities and Trustee Investment Act (Scotland) 2005.\n\nQuestions about SCIOs? [Watch this video](http://www.oscr.org.uk/news/video-scio-faqs) from OSCR for all the answers. \n\n## Two tier or single tier?\nThere are two structures available for the SCIO, two tier and single tier.\n\nThe two tier structure is similar to that of a voluntary association and a company limited by guarantee where it is the membership of the organisation that appoint trustees and have decision making powers.\n\nThe single tier structure is similar to a trust in that the trustees appoint new trustees and don’t have to answer to a wider body.\n\nBoth structures require at least two members (in the single tier SCIO the members and the Trustees are the same people) and must have at least three trustees.\n\nAdvantages |\tDisadvantages\n--- | ---\nProvides the key benefits of becoming a company, such as a defined legal entity and limited liability whilst removing some of the associated burdens. |\tExistence is dependent upon charitable status. Loss of charitable status would mean that the SCIO would cease to exist.\nCan hold property, enter into leases and other contracts, employ people, etc, in its own name. |\tSome changes must be notified to OSCR, and some require prior consent, eg change of name or charitable purposes.\nLess administration – no requirement to notify any regulator about appointments or resignations of board members. |\tMembers are subject to some of the same duties as charity trustees, specifically, they must act in the interests of the SCIO, and seek, in good faith, to ensure the SCIO acts in a manner which is consistent with its charitable purposes.\nUnlike company law, where the volume of legislation and case law can be overwhelming, the law relating to SCIOs is self-contained and very manageable. |\tThere is a duty to keep and supply a register of charity trustees and members (if an organisation has a lot of fluidity in its membership eg a Student Union, a SCIO may not be the most appropriate legal form). | \nIt provides creditor protection and reassurance for those entering into contracts. |\tCannot convert or amalgamate with non-SCIO, though assets can be transferred to a non-SCIO charitable organisation.\nOnly needs to be registered with OSCR, unlike a charitable company, which also needs to register with Companies House. \t \nIs subject to the same accounting thresholds as unincorporated charities, so may not have to produce fully accrued accounts. \t \nGenerally regarded by funding bodies and public agencies as a more ‘stable’ structure than a voluntary association. \t \n\n\n## How is it governed?\nThere is no standard format for a SCIO constitution, but some basic elements are required:\n\n* a SCIO should have two or more members and three trustees (in the case of a single tier SCIO the members can also be the trustees)\n* it should have the name, purposes, a registered office in Scotland, and include any restrictions on powers\n* it should list meeting procedures (convening, recording, quorum, voting, resolution)\n* it should list membership rules (eligibility, appointment, withdrawal) and trustee rules (appointment, withdrawal, remuneration restrictions, conflict of interest).\n* it should list the purposes for which surplus assets may be used on dissolution\n\n## Charitable status?\nA SCIO can only be a charity. OSCR is the regulator of a SCIO’s legal form, not just its charitable status. Removal from the Register equals dissolution.\nDoes it have a legal status, distinct from those who run it?\n\nYes. A SCIO can hold property, enter into leases and employ people in its own right. Title to land and buildings will be held in the name of the SCIO (an advantage in terms of succession). Members’ and trustees’ liability is limited in most cases, and they are not liable to contribute if the SCIO is wound up.\n\n## Write your constitution\nFind detailed information on [how to write a SCIO constitution](/setting-up-a-charity/write-your-constitution), with a model and clause by clause guidance.",

Once this occurs, the trustees own the asset, but can only apply it in accordance with the trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries.\n\nA trust is not regulated by an external regulator (unless it is a charity), but is subject to various legislation, eg Trusts (Scotland) Acts 1921 and 1961 If it is charitable it will be subject to charity law and regulated by OSCR.\n\nIf you are considering setting up as a Trust and are planning to apply for charitable status, why not consider setting up as a single-tier [Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation](scio.md)? This is a corporate body which provides limited liability for its trustees and is suitable for organisations that want to become charities, but do not want or need the complex structure of company law.\n\nAdvantages |\tDisadvantages\n--- | ---\nLittle or no set up costs. |\tAlthough the law gives greater recognition to the trust (as compared with a voluntary association) as having some form of identity , it is still not a full legal “entity” in the way that a SCIO or company limited by guarantee is.\nLess administration than a voluntary association, SCIO, company limited by guarantee or IPS, since there is no register of members to maintain, no collection of subscriptions, etc. |\tLeases/formal contracts have to be entered into in names of trustees. Each time one of these individuals leaves, the assets must be legally transferred to another. The same goes for any legal arrangements the trust has entered into in this way.\nNo formal registration requirements unless a charity, which will be accountable to OSCR. |\tLegal proceedings cannot be taken by the trust but only by individuals representing it. Similarly, legal proceedings would be taken out against individuals rather than the organisation.\nNo detailed statutory procedures to be followed in relation to members’ meetings, etc. |\tTrustees could be personally liable for debts if the organisation were unable to meet its debts and liabilities out of its own resources.\nUseful if you want to retain control amongst a small body of people with no external membership. |\tThere is no concept of accountability to a wider membership or to partner bodies/agencies. In particular a trust could not hold meaningful AGMs since no one other than the trustees themselves would have voting rights.\nNo requirement to notify changes in trustees to any public register nor any requirement to file accounts unless a charity. | Could be seen as “less professional” in the eyes of potential funders.\nLikely to be less intimidating than a company limited by guarantee or IPS for those considering whether to participate in decision making. \t\n\n## How is it governed?\nA trust is usually created by a document known as a deed. If a charity, the trust deed must be approved by OSCR.\n\n## Charitable status?\nYou may choose to set up a trust and register as a Scottish charity if the trust meets the criteria for being a charity. Equally, you can set up a trust without seeking charitable status.\n\n## Does it have a legal status, distinct from those who run it?\nNo. It’s an unincorporated body and those running it, the trustees, have personal liability for its debts and obligations. Trustees must undertake transactions on behalf of the body. Title to land and buildings must be held in the name of one or more individuals on behalf of the charity. Charity trustees may have personal liability for the charity’s actions and unlimited liability when it is wound up.\n\n## Write your constitution\nYou can [download this model trust deed]**(http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCVO-Trust-modelTrustdeed.doc) and use it as the basis for your own organisation’s constitution.

If you are pursuing charitable status, your steering group will be limited in how far you can depart from the model. Those areas are identified in the detailed clause-by-clause commentary set out below.\n\n## Clause by clause guidance\nFollow [our detailed clause-by-clause commentary]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCVO-Trust-guidance.pdf on the model constitution; find explanations of what the clause is there for, whether it is required by law, and information about decisions to be made between alternative possibilities.\n\n## Additional clauses\nThese are [additional clauses you may want to use]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCVO-Trust-bolt-ons.pdf, again modelled on the most common variants within the sector. They cover such things as:\n\n* Appointment of trustees nominated by corporate and specified outside bodies\n* Appointment and removal of trustees\n\nIn practical terms, the question of who should be appointed as a trustee where a vacancy arises is left to the discretion of the remaining trustees. However you can use the trust deed to give an element of direction in making future appointments by including a requirement to ensure they reflect certain stated principles. Some suggested provisions are included here.\n\n## Forming the Trust\n### Consultation\nYou should circulate the first draft of your trust deed among the steering group so everyone has the opportunity to comment. A trust will be formed without necessarily involving the wider community. If it is felt appropriate that there should be some form of wider consultation, then it is up to your steering group to decide what form that should take. (Given that once the trust is formed, there would be no procedure for electing/re-electing trustees, it would not be particularly appropriate to hold a public meeting to elect the first trustees.)\n\n### Signing your trust deed\nAs and when the draft is finalised, the process of forming the trust simply involves the completion of the signing page of the trust deed, by inserting the number of pages in the document, excluding the signing page, and also the full name of the people (or bodies) named at the start of the trust deed as being the parties who are creating the trust. It should be noted that there is no need for a trustee to sign unless they are one of the people who are creating the trust.\n\nEach of the people creating the trust should then sign on the last page of the document in the presence of one witness who should then sign opposite the signatures. Finally the signed document should be completed by inserting the place of signing (ie nearest post town), the date and the full name and address of the witness. If a corporate body is signing, you should follow the requirements in relation to the signing of a formal document which apply in relation to a body of that kind, eg in the case of a limited company, signatures of two directors, or one director plus company secretary, or one director or secretary plus witness.\n\n### Applying to OSCR\nIf the trust is pursuing recognition as a charity, a certified copy of the trust deed should be submitted to OSCR.\n\n### Keep a copy\nEach of trustees should be given a copy of the trust deed for future reference, and a copy should also be sent to any accountant engaged by the trust.\n\nIn order to protect against the possibility of the trust deed being lost in the future, it would be advisable to register the trust deed in the Books of Council and Session. This is a public register which takes in important documents and issues official extracts; an official extract is treated as equivalent to the original signed document for legal purposes. There is a cost involved in this.",

Is your aim to bring about change or provide a service for the benefit of your community?\n\nYou’ll find material here to help you think through some of the key issues relating to starting a voluntary organisation in Scotland and deciding on what needs to happen next.\n\n## Meet the need\nIf you are considering setting up a new voluntary organisation you should be clear about the needs which it will meet.  What is new and unique about your work or campaign? Is there an unmet need that you can fulfil?\n\nThere are more than 45,000 voluntary organisations in Scotland. One or more of these may well be dealing with similar issues or offering similar services. Could you persuade them to campaign on your issues or deliver that service instead?\n\nIf you do plan to deliver a new service, or have a new idea, have you checked out whether there is sufficient demand and the right resources to support that service?\n\n## Build a team\nYou can’t do this all alone; you will need other enthusiastic and committed people to form a steering group or committee for the new organisation. Volunteers should have the time, skills, knowledge, contacts and ideas necessary to get things up and running. This group will also need to bond as a team, to get things done.\nDefine your aims and purpose\n\nOnce you’ve established the team, you will need to agree why the organisation exists and who it will benefit. This will help you get support and be clear about what your focus should be. Usually, an organisation will develop:\n\n**Vision**: your view of what your organisation is for.\n\n**Mission**: this spells out what you intend to do to turn that vision into reality.\n\n**Values**: shared beliefs about the way you should operate.\n\nThese should link and together they provide your framework for operation.  Good organisations will periodically revisit these every few years to ensure that they are still relevant and work well.\n\n## Decide on a name\nUnder charity law, OSCR can refuse to register a charity if it considers that the name is:\n\n* the same as or too similar to another charity\n* likely to mislead the public as to the true nature of the organisation\n* likely to give the impression that the organisation is connected to Scottish or UK government or local authorities, when in fact it is not \n* offensive\n\nThese points are important to consider even if you are not applying for charitable status.",

It will also help you to ensure that everyone on your steering group or committee has a shared understanding of what you are trying to do and how you are trying to achieve it.\n\n## Decide on the level of detail\nThe complexity of your plan will depend on the ambitions of your organisation. If you aim to employ staff and handle significant amounts of money, you are going to need a more detailed and rigorous plan than one required by a group which is happy to stay small, informal and solely volunteer run.\n\n## Plan for action\nUse your [vision, mission and values](get-started.md) as a starting place for developing your thinking about your new organisation. Work with your steering group and other volunteers to develop the detailed plan. Then, share out the tasks. Planning needs to be co-ordinated, but should never be the responsibility of one person.\n\nThe formal business of appointing trustees or committee members and assigning long term roles will follow, once you have decided on the right legal structure for your organisation.\n\n## Decide on a structure\nYou are not required by law to adopt a legal structure unless you aim to be registered as a charity, but there are benefits to any organisation in [having a formal structure](decide-on-structure.md), particularly when things do not go to plan. It provides a framework and gives your group an identity, continuity, credibility and a means of establishing common objectives.\n\nIf you decide to adopt a formal structure you will need to make fundamental decisions about [membership](decide-on-membership.md), [charitable status](decide-on-status.md) and [incorporation](consider-the-risks.md).\n\n## Write a business plan\nJust as a business plan is an important step when planning a new business, your new organisation can benefit too. Voluntary Organisations need to go through the same rigorous planning process as any other business, thinking about marketing, finance and internal operations. A business plan will provide a solid foundation to build on in the future. Find out more about writing a [business plan](running-your-organisation/business-planning/writing-business-plan.md).",

You will not be able to take advantage of any tax relief available to charities until you have received confirmation from HMRC.\n\n## Publicising your charitable status\nAll external documents and communications and your website homepage must state your charity’s name and Scottish Charity number. OSCR provides detailed information on how to fulfil this duty.\n\nIf you are a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation, OSCR provides additional advice on how to refer to your name and status. If your organisation is incorporated, [company law](http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/) sets out rules about how you must publicise your legal status on business communications, in your offices, and on your website.\n\n## Running your organisation\nFind a wide range of relevant information about running your organisation, including information on finances, business planning and employment.\n\n## Other support\nThird Sector Interfaces are based across all of Scotland’s local authority areas. They exist to support, promote, develop and represent the third sector. You can find your nearest TSI using the directory on the [Voluntary Action Scotland](http://www.vascotland.org/) website.\n\n## Ongoing practical support from SCVO\n[SCVO membership]**http://www.scvo.org.uk/join-us/** offers your organisation information and advice, helps you to make the best use of your resources, to make connections, enables learning and development, and provides opportunities for you to network and influence.",

        "en" : "# Write your constitution\nOnce you have decided on your legal structure and are ready to draft your constitution you may find it helpful to base it on one of the models that we have developed.\n\nThe material here should enable you to draft, adjust and finalise your constitution and form your voluntary organisation.\n\nThere will be some organisations which demand specialised provisions in their constitution and there are some circumstances where legal advice will be helpful. Note that there are only a limited number of solicitors in Scotland who deal regularly with the drafting of legal structures for charitable/voluntary sector bodies. [The Law Society of Scotland](https://www.lawscot.org.uk/) has a list of legal firms with specialist charitable experience.\n\nIf you are a member of SCVO with an income of less than £500,000, then you can get legal advice and help with drafting your constitution from our Free Legal Advice Service.\n\n## Find the right model constitution\nFor each type of legal structure commonly found in the voluntary sector in Scotland we have provided a model constitution, plus detailed clause-by-clause notes and optional additional clauses.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to simply take the model and fill in the blanks relating to your organisation, you may then find you end up with a document which does not work for you, since every organisation has its own priorities and approach.\n\nThink it through: it is important that everyone in the steering group should think carefully about the features in the constitution – so that it is a real reflection of what people want to achieve, in relation to the structure for the organisation.\n\n### [Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation](decide-on-structure/scio.md)\nA Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation is a legal structure developed especially for charities in Scotland. Find out how to write a constitution for a SCIO.\n\n### [Voluntary Association](decide-on-structure/voluntary-or-unincorporated-association.md)\nWhile a voluntary or unincorporated association is a simple legal form, it still requires a constitution. Find help and resources here to write a constitution for a voluntary association.\n\n### [Company Limited by Guarantee](decide-on-structure/company-limited-by-guarantee.md)\nA company limited by guarantee can be used as a legal structure both for charities and for other not for profit organisations. Find out how to write a constitution for a company limited by guarantee.\n\n### [Trust](decide-on-structure/trust.md)\nTo set up a trust you will need to prepare a trust deed. Our model trust deeds, notes and guidance can help you write a trust deed.\n\n## Other things to think about\nEach of our models contain a lot of material. Before you start there are a number of common issues that you need to think about, whatever legal structure you choose.\n\n### The name of your organisation\nCheck with SCVO, OSCR, Companies House and also your local Third Sector Interface whether there is some other organisation which operates under a similar name. In terms of general legal principles, the other organisation could, in those circumstances, raise a court action against the new organisation on the grounds of ‘passing-off’, ie on the basis that the public were being misled.\n\nIf there is an organisation with a similar name, but you think that they are unlikely to object, then it’s best to get a letter from them to that effect, just in case a different view is taken in the future if new people come onto the board of that other body.\n\nUnder charity law, OSCR will refuse to register a charity if it considers that the name is:\n\n* the same as or too similar to another charity\n* likely to mislead the public as to the true nature of the organisation\n* likely to give the impression that the organisation is connected to Scottish or UK government or local authorities, when in fact it is not\n* offensive\n\nYou should not use the word ‘Limited’ in the name of a voluntary association or trust – doing so, if the body does not have limited liability, is a criminal offence.\n\nThere are certain important considerations when choosing a suitable name for a voluntary sector company. For more information on this see Company limited by guarantee.\n\n### The objects of your organisation\nThe constitution should set out clearly the main objects of your organisation. If applying for charitable status, then your objects will have to incorporate terminology from the list of charitable purposes set out in section 7 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. There will also be a need to show OSCR that the ‘public benefit test’ is satisfied. More detailed guidance on this is available from OSCR.\n\nWhether or not charitable status is being pursued, the objects clause has two main aspects. It guides future boards in relation to the range of activities which the organisation should pursue, and it identifies for those dealing with the organisation what the organisation is set up to do. This could include people considering whether to join as members, and importantly, bodies which are considering if they will provide funding.\n\nLook at the objects clauses of other bodies operating in a similar field if you need some guidance, but remember that it is very important that the wording which is used in your constitution does accurately reflect the aims and activities which your organisation will be pursuing in practice.\n\n### The composition of your management committee\nThe role of your management committee or board is to control and supervise the activities of your organisation. Your board will meet on a regular basis, most commonly once a month, to receive reports from individual trustees and/or members of staff, discuss important issues, plan for the future, and importantly, monitor the financial position of your organisation. Some careful thought should be given to the composition of the board.\n\nThe maximum number of board members should be set at a level which allows for an appropriate level of representation, but should not be set so high that effective decision-making becomes difficult.\n\nUsually at any general meeting of a two-tier membership organisation (eg a SCIO, a voluntary association, or company limited by guarantee) any member can put themselves forward for election as a board member. Similarly existing board members must put themselves forward for re-election by the members, either annually or perhaps at intervals of three years. The idea here is that although the members cannot, for practical reasons, all contribute directly to decision making at board level, they should have input into the question of who should be taking such decisions.\n\nThere is often a separate category of board members who are not elected by the membership but are co-opted by the other members of the board on the basis that they have special expertise, or represent outside bodies. If the board decides that a co-option should be made then you should decide whether or not they should have a vote on the board, and include the appropriate provisions in your constitution.\n\nIn any two-tier structure, you should consider whether all members of the board retire from office each year, and are then eligible for re-election. This allows the maximum opportunity for new people to come onto the board. However, this does bring the risk of a loss of continuity. If that is a concern, then the constitution can be changed so that only a proportion of the board retire from office each year. The most common arrangement would be for this to be set at one-third of the board. If any board members were co-opted they would all retire each year.\n\nEven if members are willing to re-elect someone as a board member, you may want to include a clause in the constitution that would debar a board member from serving for too long so as to ensure that “new blood” is introduced from time to time. This is covered in the additional clauses section of our models.\n\n## And finally, have you thought about…?\n**Standing Orders**\n\nIt is always possible to set out some of the more detailed provisions (so long as they are not in conflict with what is set out in the constitution itself) in the form of standing orders or policy statements eg detailed voting procedures and conflict-of-interest rules. It should be recognised, though, that setting out provisions in documents which are separate from the main constitution can make them less accessible.\n\n**Future changes**\n\nThe constitution can be changed at any time, providing the appropriate resolution is passed at a meeting of the members (though it should be noted that any change to a charitable body’s objects or purposes will require OSCR’s prior consent). So you could start off your voluntary organisation with a very simple form of constitution, and then build in further material (eg. provision for a membership subscription or more detailed categories in relation to the people serving on the management committee), at a later stage.\n\n**Should outside organisations vet your constitution?** \n\nIn many cases, it will be a condition of funding for a project that the prospective funding body approves the terms of the constitution. It’s important that you establish at an early stage what sort of features would be acceptable or unacceptable to them, eg some funders require that the constitution states that where two signatures of board members are required they should be unrelated and not live at the same address. If your organisation is to be affiliated to a larger body then you should check what would be acceptable to them.\n\n**A seat on the board?**\n\nIf there are outside organisations with which you will have close contact in carrying out your activities, again it would be sensible to bring them into the process at an appropriate point, and possibly reserve a seat on the board for people nominated by a key partner body.\n\n**The wider community**\n\nIn practice, most steering groups consist of a relatively small number of people, and there is no legal requirement to involve the wider community. However, from a practical point of view, if an organisation is intended to represent a particular community it would be advisable to establish the legitimacy of the organisation and its board, by having some sort of wider consultation at an appropriate stage. Again many prospective funding bodies will require evidence of the need for a particular project, and details of wider consultations could provide valuable evidence to support a funding application.\n\nRather than work with our general models you may find that there is already a model constitution specific to your sector available from a regional or Scottish umbrella organisation, or relevant support agency, which you could adopt.
